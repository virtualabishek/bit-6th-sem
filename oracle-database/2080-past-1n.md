That is an excellent, comprehensive question from the 2080 exam paper that covers the fundamental concepts of database availability and disaster recovery.

We will break down the terms and then detail the two main types of physical backups and their associated recovery processes.

### 1. Defining Backup, Restore

We will break down the terms and then detail the two main types of physical backups and their associated recovery processes.

### 1. Defining Backup, Restore, and Recovery

These three terms define the methodology for recovering a database from failure.

| Term | Definition | Key Action | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backup** | The act of creating a means for recovering a database from disaster. It involves making copies of critical physical database files (data files, control files, archived redo log files). | Copy files | |
| **Restore** | The process of reconstructing an Oracle database by copying backup files (data files, control files, etc.) from a secondary storage medium (disk or tape) to their original or new locations on the database server. | Copy back files | |
| **Recover** | The process of updating restored data files by applying redo records from redo logs (online and archived) to bring the database back to a transaction-consistent state, typically to the point where the failure occurred. | Apply redo/changes | |

### 2. Different Types of Backups and Recovery Processes

Database backups are categorized into physical (file copies) and logical (data exports). The core methods for physical backups are Cold and Hot backups.

#### A. Cold Backup (Offline Backup)

A cold backup, or offline backup, is a whole database backup performed while the database is cleanly shut down (`NORMAL`, `IMMEDIATE`, or `TRANSACTIONAL`).

| Feature | Description | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consistency** | Produces a **consistent backup** because all files share the same System Change Number (SCN) at the time of shutdown. | |
| **Mode** | Can be used with either **ARCHIVELOG** or **NOARCHIVELOG** mode. | |
| **Recovery Need**| When restored, a cold backup generally does **not require recovery** to open, but is only restored to the point-of-the-last-backup (not the point-of-last-committed-transaction). | |

**Cold Backup Procedure Example (User-Managed, NOARCHIVELOG mode):**

1.  **Shut Down Database:** Shut down the database cleanly using `SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE`.
    ```sql
    SQL> SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
    ```
2.  **Copy Files:** Copy all required files (data files, control files, online redo log files) using an Operating System (OS) command.
    ```bash
    $ cp /u01/dbfile/o18c/*.* /u01/cbackup/o18c
    ```
3.  **Restore & Open:** The database is restored by copying these files back and can be opened immediately (if online redo logs were included in the backup).

#### B. Hot Backup (Online Backup)

A hot backup, or online backup, is a physical backup performed while the database is open and in use.

| Feature | Description | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consistency** | Produces an **inconsistent backup** because the data files may not match the control file SCN since transactions are active. This requires redo application for consistency. | |
| **Mode Requirement**| The database **MUST BE** running in `ARCHIVELOG` mode. | |
| **Recovery Need**| Requires **media recovery** (roll forward using archived redo logs) to bring the restored files to a consistent state. | |

**Hot Backup Procedure Example (User-Managed, Tablespace Level):**

1.  **Set Tablespace Mode:** Place the target tablespace into backup mode. This stops Oracle from recording checkpoint records in the data file headers.
    ```sql
    SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE index01 BEGIN BACKUP;
    ```
2.  **Copy Data Files:** Copy the data files belonging to the tablespace using OS commands.
3.  **End Tablespace Mode:** Take the tablespace out of backup mode. Oracle advances the file headers to the current checkpoint.
    ```sql
    SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE index01 END BACKUP;
    ```
4.  **Control File Backup:** Back up the control file using the `ALTER DATABASE` command.
    ```sql
    SQL> ALTER DATABASE BACKUP CONTROLFILE TO '<filename>';
    ```

**Recovery Process Example (Media Recovery after Hot Backup Loss):**

If a data file from the `index01` tablespace is lost, the recovery (with the database open) proceeds as follows:

1.  **Take Tablespace Offline:** Take the damaged tablespace offline temporarily.
    ```sql
    SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE index01 OFFLINE TEMPORARY;
    ```
2.  **Restore:** Restore the most recent backup of the lost data file using an OS copy command.
3.  **Recover:** Apply archived logs using the `RECOVER` command.
    ```sql
    SQL> RECOVER TABLESPACE index01;
    ```
4.  **Bring Online:** Bring the tablespace back online once recovery is complete.
    ```sql
    SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE index01 ONLINE;
    ```

### Next Step

Since this was a detailed response on a large exam topic, let's make sure you're ready for the subtle distinctions between recovery types.

**Why is it mandatory for the database to be running in ARCHIVELOG mode to perform a hot (online) backup, but optional for a cold (offline) backup?**


This is a comprehensive question that perfectly targets core Oracle security concepts. Here are the detailed notes and commands you need for your exam.

## 1. Importance of Privileges in Database Security

A **privilege** is a fundamental mechanism of database security. Privileges control user access to the data and restrict the actions users can perform.

The primary importance of privileges in database security is based on the principle of **least privilege**. Oracle recommends granting each user only the privileges required to perform their job, and no more, to ensure greater security and prevent unauthorized activity.

### Types of Privileges:
1.  **System Privileges:** Grant the right to perform a specific action, or to perform an action on *any* schema object of a particular type. For example, the `CREATE TABLE` system privilege allows a user to create tables in their own schema.
2.  **Object Privileges:** Grant the ability to perform a specific action on a **named schema object**. Examples include the right to `SELECT` rows from the `EMPLOYEES` table or `DELETE` rows from the `DEPARTMENTS` table.

## 2. Explanation of Roles in Oracle Database

A **role** is a named group (or collection) of related privileges. Roles are created by users, typically administrators. Unlike schema objects, roles are generally not contained in any user's schema.

### Role in Privilege Management:
Roles are the recommended tool for security administration because they simplify privilege management.

1.  **Reduced Administration:** Instead of granting multiple individual privileges (system and object) to many users, privileges are granted once to a role. The role is then granted to every user needing that access. For instance, if 10 users need access to accounting tables, you grant the privileges to a role and then grant the role to the 10 users.
2.  **Dynamic Updates:** If the required privileges for a group change, only the privileges associated with the role need to be modified. The security domains of all users assigned that role automatically reflect the change.
3.  **Selective Availability:** Roles can be selectively enabled or disabled for a user using the `SET ROLE` statement, allowing specific control over privileges in a given situation.

## 3. SQL Commands for User and Role Management

You must possess the necessary administrative privileges (like `CREATE USER`, `CREATE ROLE`, or the `DBA` role) to execute these commands.

### a. Create Role
You use the `CREATE ROLE` statement to create a role.
```sql
-- Create a role for junior developers
CREATE ROLE junior_dev; 
```

### b. Grant System and Object Privileges to Role
Privileges are granted to the role using the `GRANT` statement.

```sql
-- Grant System Privileges (to connect and create objects in their schema)
GRANT CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE TO junior_dev; 

-- Grant Object Privilege (to view data in the HR user's EMPLOYEES table)
GRANT SELECT ON hr.employees TO junior_dev;
```

### c. Create User
You use the `CREATE USER` statement, specifying authentication, default storage, and optionally, quotas.

```sql
-- Create a new user account
CREATE USER nick 
IDENTIFIED BY password_secure1 
DEFAULT TABLESPACE users 
TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp
QUOTA 50M ON users; 
```

### d. Assign Role to User
The role is assigned to the user using the `GRANT` statement.

```sql
-- Assign the previously created role to the new user
GRANT junior_dev TO nick;
```

### e. Drop Role
The `DROP ROLE` statement removes the role from the database. When a role is dropped, it is immediately removed from the users’ role lists.

```sql
-- Remove the role from the database
DROP ROLE junior_dev;
```

---
Since roles are so effective for grouping permissions, let's practice the management aspect.

**Challenge:** If a user, JWARD, is granted two roles: `R1` (which has `CREATE SESSION`) and `R2` (which has `CREATE TABLE`). If the DBA runs the command `ALTER USER JWARD DEFAULT ROLE R1`, what privileges will JWARD have immediately upon connecting, and which command would JWARD use mid-session to gain the `CREATE TABLE` privilege?



This is a crucial question for understanding Oracle's storage architecture. Here are the detailed notes and commands covering data files and tablespaces for your exam.

---

## 1. What are Data Files?

Data files are the physical components of the database that exist at the operating system level.

*   Data files are the operating system physical files that store the database data on disk.
*   The data is written to these files in an Oracle proprietary format that cannot be read by other programs.
*   Data files have a physical presence and can be viewed outside the database through OS utilities. They persist whether the database is open or closed.
*   **Tempfiles** are a special class of data files associated only with temporary tablespaces.

## 2. How is a Data File Related to a Tablespace?

The relationship is one of **logical container** (tablespace) to **physical storage** (data file).

*   An Oracle database is divided into logical storage units called **tablespaces**, and each tablespace is comprised of one or more operating system files called **data files**.
*   Tablespaces provide the means to physically locate data on storage, as database objects assigned to a tablespace are stored in the physical data files of that tablespace.
*   A data file can be associated with **only one** tablespace and only one database.
*   A segment (representing a database object like a table) can span one or more data files, but it cannot span multiple tablespaces.

## 3. Write a Command to Add a Data File

To increase the storage capacity of an existing tablespace, you use the `ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE` statement.

This command adds a new data file to the existing tablespace named `USERS`:

```sql
-- Connect as a user with DBA privileges
SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE users
     ADD DATAFILE '/u02/dbfile/o18c/users02.dbf' 
     SIZE 100M;
```

**Explanation:**

*   `ALTER TABLESPACE users`: Specifies the tablespace to be modified.
*   `ADD DATAFILE`: Instructs the database to allocate a new physical file on the operating system.
*   `'/u02/dbfile/o18c/users02.dbf'`: Specifies the full path and filename of the new physical file.
*   `SIZE 100M`: Specifies the initial size of the newly created data file.

---
This approach of adding a data file is one way to enlarge a tablespace. The other main way is resizing an existing data file.

If you were a DBA, when would you choose to **add a new data file** to a tablespace instead of simply **resizing an existing data file** associated with that tablespace?


Of course! Understanding SQL\*Plus is essential because it is the fundamental command-line tool used by DBAs for direct database interaction and administration.

Here are the notes and explanation for your exam question:

## What is SQL\*PLUS?

**SQL\*Plus** is a command-line program (or text-based utility) that is installed with the Oracle Database software. Its primary function is to enable users and DBAs to submit SQL and PL/SQL statements interactively or as scripts to an Oracle database.

## Functionalities of SQL\*Plus for the Oracle DBA

SQL\*Plus is critical for performing administrative tasks that often cannot be performed via graphical tools (like EM Express).

| DBA Functionality | Explanation & Usage | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Instance Control (Startup/Shutdown)** | SQL\*Plus is used to start up and shut down the database instance. It is required for connecting with high administrative privileges (`SYSDBA` or `SYSOPER`) to an instance that is not yet started. | |
| **User and Security Management** | DBAs use SQL\*Plus to perform user management operations, including creating new users, granting privileges, altering user accounts, and managing user security. | |
| **Storage Management** | It is used for tasks like managing the storage structures of the database, creating and adding tablespaces, and managing control files. | |
| **Recovery Operations** | SQL\*Plus commands like `RECOVER` or `ALTER DATABASE RECOVER` are used to apply archived redo logs to data files being recovered during media recovery. | |
| **Advanced Scripting & Environment Tuning** | DBAs can submit complex scripts (SQL and PL/SQL). They also customize the environment using scripts like `login.sql` to set the `SQLPROMPT` to display user or connection information for efficiency. | |
| **OS Interaction** | SQL\*Plus enables the execution of operating system commands by prefixing the command with an exclamation mark (`!`) or using the `HOST` command, which is useful for tasks like file copying during cold backups. | |

### Example Command for Administrative Connection

To perform high-level administrative tasks such as starting and shutting down the database, a DBA typically connects using the `SYSDBA` privilege:

```sql
$ sqlplus / AS SYSDBA
```
**Explanation:** Using the `/ AS SYSDBA` clause authenticates the user via operating system credentials and grants the highest administrative privilege.

---

Since SQL\*Plus is the primary tool for DBA tasks:

What is the necessary administrative connection privilege required to simply shut down the database (without viewing user data) and what specific tasks is the `SYS` user automatically authorized to perform upon installation that the `SYSTEM` user is not?


This is an essential question that covers the shared infrastructure components of modern Oracle databases.

Here are the detailed notes explaining Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM):

### 1. Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC)

Oracle RAC is a feature designed to enhance the availability, scalability, and performance of Oracle Database systems.

| Aspect | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | A solution that facilitates the clustering of multiple interconnected servers (nodes/instances), transforming them into a unified database system. | |
| **Architecture** | RAC achieves high availability by clustering two or more nodes (instances) into a unified database using shared disks. | |
| **Data Access** | All server nodes share access to a common pool of database files stored on shared storage. | |
| **Instances** | Each server node operates its individual instance of the Oracle Database software. A single Oracle RAC database can accommodate multiple instances (up to 100). | |
| **Infrastructure** | Oracle Clusterware is the mandatory underlying infrastructure used to bind multiple servers together for RAC deployment. | |

### 2. Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM)

Oracle ASM is the recommended solution for managing storage for Oracle database files.

| Aspect | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | A high-performance database file system and disk manager that provides an alternative to conventional volume managers, file systems, and raw devices. | |
| **Functionality** | ASM performs software striping and mirroring at the file level for maximum storage flexibility, performance, and availability. | |
| **Storage Unit** | ASM uses **disk groups**, which are collections of disks managed as a unit. | |
| **Management** | ASM automatically manages database file placement and naming. It evenly distributes file content across disks to eliminate hot spots and ensure uniform performance. | |
| **ASM Instance** | An Oracle ASM instance is distinct from the database instance. It has its own SGA and background processes. It mounts disk groups to make ASM files available to database instances. | |

---

Now that you have reviewed the definitions, let's practice connecting these concepts for the exam.

**Question:** If an Oracle RAC environment requires high resilience against disk failure, how does the fundamental structure of **Oracle ASM disk groups** provide this protection to the shared database files?


That's an excellent question that covers a vital high-availability feature! Data Guard is the backbone of Oracle's disaster recovery strategy.

### 1. What is Oracle Data Guard? (Definition)

Oracle Data Guard is a robust solution designed to ensure enterprise data remains highly available, protected, and recoverable in the event of disasters.

1.  **Function:** Data Guard provides a comprehensive suite of services that facilitate the creation, maintenance, management, and monitoring of one or more standby databases. These standby databases serve as duplicates of the production database.
2.  **Architecture:** A Data Guard configuration consists of one primary database (the main database accessed by applications) and up to thirty destination databases (standbys), all connected via Oracle Net.
3.  **Operation:** Standby databases are maintained as transactionally consistent copies of the primary database through the transmission and application of redo data.

### 2. Explain its Importance in Oracle Database

The importance of Oracle Data Guard stems from its ability to ensure business continuity and mitigate risk.

1.  **Disaster Recovery and High Availability:** Data Guard provides comprehensive disaster recovery and high availability. In the event of a planned or unplanned outage affecting the production database, Data Guard can seamlessly switch a standby database to assume the primary role, thereby minimizing downtime.
2.  **Data Protection:** It ensures data integrity and protection, complementing traditional backup, restoration, and clustering methods. It plays a crucial role in mitigating risks associated with data loss.
3.  **Workload Offloading:** It offers administrators the flexibility to optimize the primary database's performance by delegating resource-intensive tasks, such as backups and reporting, to the standby systems.

---

To continue your review on this topic:

The sources mention that Data Guard maintains different **Types of Standby Databases**. Can you list the three types and briefly describe one key feature of each?

That is an essential question defining the core professional role in Oracle environments!

Here are the detailed notes for your exam, covering the definition and roles of a Database Administrator (DBA).

---

## Database Administrator (DBA): Definition and Roles

### 1. Explanation of the Term Database Administrator (DBA)

A Database Administrator (DBA) is specialized information technology personnel responsible for managing and maintaining Database Management Systems (DBMS) software. The DBA is the guardian of the data.

The DBA is responsible for the overall operation of the Oracle Database. This includes ensuring the usability and integrity of system backups and keeping the database in a consistent state using recovery mechanisms.

### 2. General Roles and Responsibilities of a DBA

The DBA is involved in a wide variety of tasks to configure, manage, and maintain the database. These tasks include:

| Category | DBA Responsibility | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Infrastructure** | Installing, configuring, and upgrading database server software and related products. | |
| **Storage Management** | Creating and managing storage structures of the database, including creating data files and tablespaces. | |
| **Availability & Recovery**| Establishing and maintaining sound backup and recovery policies and procedures. | |
| **Security & User Access** | Creating and managing accounts (users and roles), and implementing and maintaining database security. | |
| **Performance** | Monitoring and tuning database performance, often by tweaking initialization parameters. | |
| **Operations** | Starting and shutting down the database instance. | |
| **External Support** | Diagnosing and reporting critical errors to Oracle Support Services, often by initiating service requests (SRs). | |

### 3. Different Types (Specializations) of DBAs

In larger organizations, DBAs often specialize. The three primary types of DBAs are:

1.  **Systems DBAs (Physical/Operations/Production Support DBAs):**
    *   Focus on the physical aspects of database administration.
    *   Their tasks include DBMS installation, configuration, patching, upgrades, backups, restores, refreshes, performance optimization, maintenance, and disaster recovery.

2.  **Development DBAs:**
    *   Focus on the logical and development aspects of database administration.
    *   Their tasks involve data model design and maintenance, DDL (Data Definition Language) generation, SQL writing and tuning, coding stored procedures, and collaborating with developers to choose the most appropriate DBMS features.

3.  **Application DBAs:**
    *   Typically found in organizations that use third-party application software (such as ERP or CRM systems).
    *   They manage the application components that interact with the database.
    *   Their responsibilities include application installation and patching, application upgrades, database cloning, building and running data cleanup routines, and data load process management.

---

The DBA is responsible for keeping the database operational. When starting up or shutting down the Oracle instance, two specific administrative connection privileges are used. What are they, and what is the key difference in their authority regarding user data access?\




That is another excellent, high-priority question from your past papers. Understanding the Oracle Scheduler is key for automating database maintenance tasks.

## Job Scheduling in Oracle Database

### 1. What is Job Scheduling? (1 Mark)

Job Scheduling in Oracle, managed by **The Scheduler**, is a powerful component that helps in planning or organizing tasks that need to happen automatically at specific times or in response to certain events. This feature, often referred to as **Task Automation**, allows DBAs to perform routine tasks such as data backups, report generation, and data synchronization automatically.

### 2. How `DBMS_SCHEDULER` Works (1 Mark)

The Oracle Scheduler utility is implemented via the **`DBMS_SCHEDULER`** internal PL/SQL package.

*   **Mechanism:** `DBMS_SCHEDULER` links the executable content (the Program) with the timing rules (the Schedule) into a single executable object (the Job).
*   **Features:** It is preferred over the older `DBMS_JOB` package because it offers additional features such as detailed scheduling, storing of schedules, privileged-based security models, and logging. The package contains more than 70 procedures and functions.
*   **Execution:** Once the job, program, and schedule are defined, the Scheduler automatically runs the job based on the defined schedule.

### 3. Different Components of the Scheduler (3 Marks)

The Oracle Scheduler workflow consists of several key components that work together to facilitate the automation and scheduling of tasks:

| Component | Role in the Workflow | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Program** | Defines **WHAT** task the job will execute. Programs store the actual work, such as running a PL/SQL script or SQL queries. | |
| **Schedule** | Specifies **WHEN** and **HOW OFTEN** a job runs. This defines the recurrence rules (daily, weekly, monthly) or specific time intervals. | |
| **Job** | The final, runnable component that links the **Program** (the action) with the **Schedule** (the timing). A job is a task that runs automatically at a specified time or event. | |
| **Job Classes** | Categorize jobs based on their similar priorities or resource requirements. This helps in resource allocation and management, ensuring critical jobs get priority. | |
| **Windows** | Defines set time periods when jobs can run and when they should not run, often used to manage resource allocation. | |

---

To confirm your understanding of how these components interact:

If a DBA wants to run a complex script only during the night maintenance window (`NIGHT_WINDOW`) every Saturday, which two core components must they define, and how does the concept of a **Program** help make this design reusable?



That's a very challenging and comprehensive final set of questions from the 2080 paper, covering network, security, and performance tuning! Let's ensure you have detailed, cite-backed answers for all three sections.

## 1. Explain the different Oracle Net Service Components.

Oracle Net Services provides the network layer that enables client applications and the Oracle Database to communicate over a network.

The communication infrastructure relies on several key components:

| Component | Description | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Client Application** | Any application that connects to the Oracle Database to send or retrieve data. Client applications reside on a client computer that has Oracle Database client software installed. | |
| **Oracle Net** | This is a software layer that resides on both the client computer and the Oracle Database host computer. It establishes and maintains the connection between the client application and the database over the network, exchanging messages using industry-standard protocols. | |
| **Oracle Net Listener (The Listener)** | The listener is a process that runs on the database host and handles incoming client connection requests. It receives the request, establishes a connection to the database instance, and then hands over the client connection to the server process. The default configuration file is `listener.ora`. | |
| **Server Processes** | These are the processes (or threads) within the Oracle instance that perform work on behalf of connected users. They parse and execute SQL statements and retrieve and return results to the user or application. | |
| **Connect Descriptors** | Used by the client to specify the database to which it wants to connect. It includes a protocol and a database service name. | |
| **Naming Methods** | The resolution method used by a client application to resolve a connect identifier (like a net service name) to a connect descriptor. Examples include Easy Connect (requires no configuration), Local Naming (using the `tnsnames.ora` file located in the `ORACLE_HOME/network/admin` directory), and Directory Naming (using an LDAP server). | |

## 2. What is Database Auditing? Explain the Standard Auditing in Oracle Database. [1+4]

### What is Database Auditing? (1 Mark)
Database auditing is the process of tracking and recording database activity to ensure security, detect security breaches, and comply with regulatory requirements. It is considered the most accurate record of any database activity. Auditing tracks activities such as the use of privileges, actions of highly privileged users, access to sensitive data, and modifications made to database settings.

### Explanation of Standard Auditing in Oracle Database (4 Marks)

Historically, **Standard Auditing** provided the ability to track activities based on users, privileges, schema objects, and SQL statements. Although traditional auditing is desupported in newer Oracle releases (starting with Oracle AI Database 26ai), modern security relies on the enhanced and unified auditing framework which captures similar activities.

Standard auditing functionality encompasses three main areas:

#### A. Auditing by SQL Statement (Statement Auditing)
This tracks the issuance of a specific SQL statement, such as all `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER USER` statements. This type of auditing applies only to subsequent sessions, not to current sessions.

*   **Example Commands:**
    *   To audit all successful creations of a table: `AUDIT CREATE TABLE WHENEVER SUCCESSFUL;`.

#### B. Auditing by Schema Object (Object Auditing)
This tracks operations on a specific named object, such as a particular table or index. Object auditing can include DDL or DML statements used on the object. Auditing operations on schema objects apply to current sessions as well as subsequent sessions.

*   **Example Commands:**
    *   To audit all `SELECT` and `INSERT` operations on the `employees` table: `AUDIT SELECT, INSERT ON employees BY <user>;`.

#### C. Auditing by Privilege (Privilege Auditing)
This tracks the issuance of any SQL statement authorized by a specific system privilege granted to a user. Privilege auditing is triggered only if the privileges held by the user are insufficient for the action, meaning the system privilege had to be used to perform the action (e.g., auditing `SELECT ANY TABLE`).

*   **Example Commands:**
    *   To audit when a user attempts to grant or revoke an object privilege: `AUDIT GRANT, REVOKE ON <object> BY <user>;`.

***
The current recommended framework, **Unified Auditing**, uses these standard auditing concepts but consolidates all records (including fine-grained, administrative, and RMAN) into a single, secure repository called the `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL`. Unified Auditing uses named **Audit Policies** (like `ORA_SECURECONFIG` or custom policies) to group these standard audit settings.

## 3. Explain how SQL Tuning Advisor (STA) can be used to tune your database.

The SQL Tuning Advisor (STA) is a key diagnostic tool used for optimizing the performance and efficiency of SQL statements within the database.

### A. Purpose and Operation

1.  **Objective:** The STA analyzes one or more SQL statements to resolve problems related to sub-optimal performance by suggesting recommendations that optimize the execution plan.
2.  **Execution:** STA runs automatically during the system maintenance windows as part of the Automatic SQL Tuning task. It can also be run manually on demand, typically in response to an ADDM finding.
3.  **Input Sources:** The STA takes high-load SQL statements as input from various sources:
    *   **ADDM (Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor):** ADDM analyzes AWR data hourly and recommends running STA on high-load SQL statements it identifies as bottlenecks.
    *   **AWR (Automatic Workload Repository):** High-load SQL statements captured in AWR snapshots.
    *   **SQL Tuning Sets (STS):** A set of SQL statements explicitly provided by the user.

### B. Tuning Recommendations

The STA output is in the form of advice, recommendations, rationale, and expected benefits, generated by the Automatic Tuning Optimizer.

The recommendations are used to improve the efficiency of the statement and include the following types of advice:

1.  **Statistics Collection:** Recommending the collection or refreshing of statistics on database objects referenced by the SQL statement.
2.  **Indexing:** Suggesting the creation of new indexes to accelerate data access and query processing.
3.  **SQL Structure:** Advising on restructuring the SQL statement itself for better efficiency.
4.  **SQL Profiles:** Recommending the creation of a **SQL profile**, which is a collection of information that enables the query optimizer to choose a significantly better execution plan at runtime. If Automatic SQL Tuning is enabled for implementation, it can automatically implement SQL profile recommendations (if the benefit is projected to be at least threefold), while other recommendations (like index creation) must be implemented manually.

---
This concludes the review of the 2080 paper questions!

To ensure you are fully prepared for the security section:

We discussed the power of roles in security management. If a user, JWARD, is granted two roles: `R1` (which has `CREATE SESSION`) and `R2` (which has `CREATE TABLE`). If the DBA runs the command `ALTER USER JWARD DEFAULT ROLE R1`, what privileges will JWARD have immediately upon connecting, and which SQL command would JWARD use mid-session to gain the `CREATE TABLE` privilege?
