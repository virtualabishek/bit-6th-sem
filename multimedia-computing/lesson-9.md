## Unit 9: Multimedia Application

Multimedia applications are interactive applications that use multiple modalities, including text, images, drawings, animation, video, sound, and interactivity. Hypermedia, such as the World Wide Web, can be considered one type of multimedia application.

### I. Media Preparation and Composition

Media preparation and composition are typically addressed during the development phases of a multimedia project. The process for multimedia design is sometimes viewed as having four phases, two of which address preparation and composition: **MM Asset Production (Phase 2)** and **Integration/Composing (Phase 3)**.

#### A. Media Preparation (MM Asset Production)
A **Multimedia Asset** is an informational unit that occupies one or more perception channels of the human being, such as a text object, a picture, an audio sequence, a video clip, or a VR object.

1.  **Specialized Production:** Assets are usually produced in **separate specialized workflows** using specialized tools. Content production can be carried out by the media industry or traditional industry.
2.  **Content Research and Legalities:** Preparation involves necessary research concerning the content, clarifying **copyright issues**, and finding suitable music talent.
3.  **Adaptation and Processing:** Preparation includes the **adaptation of material** by using digital image, audio, or video processing. Examples of digital processing include:
    *   **Format conversion**.
    *   **Geometric and color transformations**.
    *   **Filtering** (e.g., adjustment of sharpness).
    *   Digitizing existing photographs, illustrations, or graphics for use in an electronic medium.

#### B. Media Composition (Integration)
**Media Integration or Composing** is the process of combining and integrating multimedia assets to create a **common context** and form a **Multimedia Product**.

1.  **Product Definition:** A **Multimedia Product** is a combined and integrated set of multimedia assets that creates an **interactive stream of information** using several perception channels.
2.  **Integration Tools and Paradigms:** Integration is typically achieved using **integration platforms/tools** (e.g., Flash, SMIL).
3.  **User Interface Elements:** The integration phase includes the creation of a common context and the **integration of navigation, control, and information entry elements** (such as buttons, rulers, and text fields).

### II. Media Integration and Communication

Multimedia integration relies heavily on robust communication and networking capabilities to deliver real-time, time-dependent data.

1.  **Networking Demands:** Multimedia applications place **great demands on networks and systems**. They require **real-time and interactive** delivery, necessitating low delay and synchronization, such as "lip sync" for audio and video.
2.  **IP Communication (MoIP):** The transport of various media (including voice, messaging, and video) as a payload of an **IP datagram** is referred to as **Multimedia over IP (MoIP)**.
3.  **Protocols for Real-Time Delivery:**
    *   **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol):** The primary standard for **audio/video transport over IP networks**. RTP provides facilities for **jitter compensation** and detection of out-of-sequence arrival in data.
    *   **RTCP (RTP Control Protocol):** A sister protocol that provides **feedback on the quality of service (QoS)** in media distribution.
    *   **RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol):** Used by real-time applications to **reserve necessary resources** at routers along transmission paths to guarantee bandwidth.
4.  **ATM Networks:** **Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)** is a type of data transmission system where transmission rates vary, but the mode of sending data is very accurate. ATM is often ubiquitous in the core of service provider networks for multimedia communication, offering **QoS guarantees** that surpass the best-effort guarantee of Internet Protocol.
5.  **Wireless and Mobile Multimedia:** Mobile networks and **3G handhelds** support emerging multimedia applications, including web browsing, video streaming, videoconferencing, and collaborative work. New protocols like **MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)** incorporate audio, images, and other multimedia content.

### III. Multimedia Application Areas

Multimedia finds application in a wide variety of areas, including creative industries, entertainment, education, engineering, medicine, and scientific research.

#### A. Media Entertainment
1.  **Creative Production:** Multimedia is **heavily used in the entertainment industry**, particularly for developing **special effects in movies and animations**.
2.  **Interactive Content:** **Interactive Multimedia** applications allow users to **actively participate** instead of just passively receiving information.
3.  **Gaming:** **Multimedia games** are a popular pastime. **Video games** are a prominent example of interactive multimedia as they meld animation, audio, and interactivity for an immersive experience.
4.  **Distribution:** Entertainment applications include **interactive TV** and **video-on-demand**.

#### B. Telemedicine
**Telemedicine** is a vital multimedia application.

1.  **Training and Simulation:** In Medicine, doctors can receive training by viewing a **virtual surgery** or simulate how the human body is affected by diseases.
2.  **Archiving and Diagnostics:** Multimedia technologies are used to prepare high-quality $\mathbf{3D}$ **magnetic resonance images** of human bodies. They are also used for archiving $\mathbf{X-ray \text{ images}}$ and $\mathbf{CT \text{ scans}}$.
3.  **Remote Monitoring:** Systems like the **Georgia Tech's Electronic Housecall system** provide **interactive health monitoring services** to patients in their homes, placing a heavy burden on existing network architectures.
4.  **Patient Relationship:** Multimedia is used in the doctor-patient relationship for obtaining patient **informed consent**.

#### C. E-learning (Educational Applications)
Multimedia applications in education are pervasive, supporting learning across various contexts.

1.  **Computer-Based Training (CBT):** Multimedia is used to produce **computer-based training courses (CBTs)**, allowing the user to go through a series of presentations, text, and associated illustrations.
2.  **Concept Clarification:** Videos and animations are used to explain **abstract concepts** in subjects like biology and physics, such as processes like cell division or the laws of motion, which are difficult to grasp through text alone. Animations that depict the interactions between atoms or molecules clarify complex subjects in chemistry.
3.  **Learning Styles:** Multimedia tools cater to diverse learning styles:
    *   **Visual learners** benefit from images, videos, diagrams, and animations.
    *   **Auditory learners** are engaged through podcasts, audio lectures, and music.
    *   **Kinesthetic learners** benefit from **interactive elements** such as virtual simulations, quizzes, and digital games.
4.  **Engagement and Retention:** Multimedia strengthens memory pathways by engaging **multiple senses simultaneously**. It increases **motivation and participation** by making learning enjoyable and interactive (e.g., through gamification).
5.  **Accessibility:** Multimedia promotes **inclusivity** by offering alternative ways to engage with material for students with learning disabilities (e.g., text-to-speech, captioned videos).

### IV. Digital Video Editing and Production Systems

Digital video editing and production systems are essential software tools for creating multimedia content.

1.  **Process:** **Video editing** is the process of manipulating and rearranging video shots to create a new work, usually considered part of the **post production** process. Editing includes rearranging, adding, or removing sections of video and audio clips; applying color correction, filters, and other enhancements; and creating transitions between clips.
2.  **Goal:** The overall goal of video editing is to decide what elements to retain, delete, or combine from various sources so they come together in an organized, logical, and visually pleasing manner.
3.  **Software Tools:** Tools available include $\mathbf{Adobe \text{ Premiere}}$, $\mathbf{Adobe \text{ After \text{ Effects}}}$, Windows Movie Maker, and Apple’s iMovie/Final Cut Pro.

### V. Video Conferencing

**Video conferencing** is a common multimedia application.

1.  **Application Type:** It is categorized as a **"dialogue mode" application** (as opposed to retrieval mode) because it requires **symmetric processing expenditure** for compression and decompression and strict delay limits.
2.  **Functionality:** Multimedia conferencing allows people to **interact across the world** using cameras, computers, and the internet. Examples of tools include Polycom.
3.  **System Requirements:** Conferencing systems need robust network support, where **RTP/RTCP** protocols are crucial for real-time transport and QoS feedback. Video conferencing requires two-way traffic.

### VI. Video-on-demand (VOD)

**Video-on-Demand (VOD)** is a service that allows users to retrieve information (such as news, weather, or movies) from a database.

1.  **Application Type:** VOD is a **"retrieval mode" application**. It is an example of a **streaming media** application, where media is constantly received and presented while being delivered by a provider.
2.  **Data Characteristics:** VOD streams are often **bursty**, meaning there may be no traffic most of the time, but bursts to high volume when the video is requested.
3.  **Compression:** VOD typically uses compression techniques optimized for retrieval applications, such as $\text{MPEG-1}$, which involves considerable effort during the compression phase.
4.  **Protocols:** VOD uses streaming media protocols like **RTSP** (Real Time Streaming Protocol).
