This is a fundamental question in Management Information Systems (MIS) and is critical for your exam preparation. Below is a comprehensive answer covering the definition of an Information System and how different systems serve the organizational hierarchy.

---

## 1. Definition of Information System (IS)

An **Information System (IS)** can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that work together to collect, process, store, and distribute information to support decision-making and control in an organization. Beyond supporting decision making and control, IS also aid in coordination, communication, analysis, and visualization.

From a business perspective, an information system is an organizational and management solution, generally technology-based, intended to address a challenge or problem posed by the environment.

### Core Activities of an Information System
Information systems produce information necessary for organizations through three basic activities:

1.  **Input:** Captures or collects raw data from within the organization or from its external environment.
2.  **Processing:** Converts this raw input data into a meaningful form. This may involve performing arithmetic/logical calculations or simply rearranging the data.
3.  **Output:** Transfers the processed information to the people who will use it or to the activities for which it will be used.

IS also rely on **feedback**, which is output returned to appropriate people or activities to evaluate and refine the input.

## 2. Information Systems at Different Levels of Management

A typical business organization is structured hierarchically, consisting of three principal levels of management: **Operational**, **Middle**, and **Senior**. Each level has different responsibilities, makes different types of decisions, and therefore requires specialized information systems to support its functions.

### A. Operational Management (Lower Level)

The operational level is responsible for monitoring the **daily activities and routine business operations** of the organization.

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus/Activities** | Day-to-day tasks, accuracy, efficiency, and routine activities. |
| **Decision Type** | **Structured Decisions**: Repetitive, routine decisions with predefined procedures and definite procedures for handling them (e.g., granting credit to a customer based on set criteria, or determining if an employee is eligible for overtime pay). |
| **Primary System** | **Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)**. |
| **System Function** | Records and performs the daily routine transactions necessary to conduct business (e.g., sales order entry, payroll, inventory control, and shipping). TPS are essential for monitoring the status of internal operations and are the major source of raw data for other systems. |

### B. Middle Management (Tactical Level)

Middle management is responsible for carrying out the **programs and plans** of senior management, focusing on monitoring, controlling, and organizational planning, administration, and resource allocation.

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus/Activities** | Monitoring department performance, setting department goals, carrying out programs, and controlling the business. |
| **Decision Type** | **Semi-structured Decisions**: Decisions where only part of the problem has a clear-cut answer, requiring a combination of data analysis and managerial judgment (e.g., figuring out why an order fulfillment report shows a decline, or designing a marketing plan). |
| **Primary Systems** | **Management Information Systems (MIS)** and **Decision-Support Systems (DSS)**. |
| **MIS Function** | Provides **routine summary reports** (often using data compressed from TPS) on the organization's current performance, which are used to monitor, control the business, and predict future performance. MIS answers routine questions with predefined procedures. |
| **DSS Function** | Supports **non-routine** and complex decision-making by focusing on unique, rapidly changing problems. DSS uses sophisticated analytical models (like "what-if" analysis) and can integrate information from internal TPS/MIS with external sources (e.g., stock prices or competitor data). |

### C. Senior Management (Strategic Level)

Senior management occupies the topmost hierarchy and is responsible for making **long-range strategic decisions** and ensuring the firm's overall financial performance and growth.

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Focus/Activities** | Long-term planning, defining 5- or 10-year goals, identifying strategic problems and opportunities, and tracking external trends. |
| **Decision Type** | **Unstructured Decisions**: Non-routine decisions requiring judgment, evaluation, and insight because there is no agreed-upon procedure for arriving at a solution (e.g., deciding whether to enter a new market or approving a capital budget). |
| **Primary System** | **Executive Support Systems (ESS)**. |
| **System Function** | Addresses unstructured, non-routine decisions. ESS draws summarized information from internal MIS/DSS and incorporates data about **external events** (competitors, tax laws). Information is filtered, compressed, and often presented visually via **digital dashboards** or portals to help executives monitor organizational performance, trends, and opportunities. |

### Diagram: Pyramid Structure of Information Systems

The different types of information systems align with the organizational hierarchy and the structure of decisions they support, often visualized as a pyramid.

This diagram illustrates:
*   **Operational Management** at the base handles **Structured Decisions** using **Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)**.
*   **Middle Management** in the middle handles **Semi-structured Decisions** using **Management Information Systems (MIS)** and **Decision Support Systems (DSS)**.
*   **Senior Management** at the top handles **Unstructured Decisions** using **Executive Support Systems (ESS)**.

| **Decision Structure** | **Management Level** | **Information System** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Unstructured | Senior/Strategic Management | ESS (Executive Support Systems) |
| Semi-structured | Middle/Tactical Management | MIS (Management Information Systems) / DSS (Decision Support Systems) |
| Structured | Operational Management | TPS (Transaction Processing Systems) |

**(Note: Although a formal figure (Figure 1.6/2.3/12.1/12.2/12.4/12.5) showing the management levels and systems exists in the source text, the table above summarizes this essential relationship clearly.)**

The impact of information systems (IS) on organizations is profound, affecting everything from day-to-day internal efficiency and economic viability to management structure, business strategy, and the quality of work life. Information systems are not just technology; they are integral, interactive tools deeply involved in the minute-to-minute operations and decision-making of modern firms.

The complex, two-way relationship between information technology (IT) and organizations is mediated by various factors, including the organization’s **structure, business processes, politics, culture, environment, and management decisions**.

Information systems fundamentally alter the economics of organizations and greatly increase the possibilities for organizing work. The major impacts can be categorized into strategic, economic, and organizational/behavioral changes.

---

## 1. Strategic Business Objectives (The Value of IS)

Businesses invest heavily in information systems to achieve six major strategic business objectives:

1.  **Operational Excellence:** IS helps firms achieve higher levels of **efficiency and productivity**. For instance, automating manual tasks reduces effort and saves time, reducing errors. Walmart uses its Retail Link system to digitally link suppliers to its stores, achieving world-class operational efficiency.
2.  **New Products, Services, and Business Models:** IS enables organizations to create new products, services, and entirely new ways of doing business. For example, downloading a Kindle e-book from Amazon or a music track from iTunes are new business processes based on new models inconceivable without IT.
3.  **Customer and Supplier Intimacy:** When a business truly knows its customers and serves them well, customers return, increasing revenues and profits. Similarly, engaging suppliers closely lowers costs by securing vital inputs.
4.  **Improved Decision Making:** Managers relying on forecasts or guesses often experience poor outcomes. IS makes it possible to use **real-time data** from the marketplace for accurate and timely decisions, enhancing organizational performance and decision-making.
5.  **Competitive Advantage:** When a firm achieves the objectives above, performing better than competitors, charging less for superior products, and responding to customers faster, it gains a competitive advantage that competitors cannot easily match.
6.  **Survival:** Sometimes, firms invest in IS and technologies simply because they are necessary for doing business, often driven by **industry requirements** (e.g., ATMs in banking) or **legal requirements** (e.g., mandatory electronic record retention for healthcare or financial services).

---

## 2. Economic Impacts

From an economic viewpoint, IT fundamentally changes the **relative costs of capital and information**.

### A. IT as a Factor of Production
Information systems technology can be substituted for traditional capital and labor.
*   As **IT costs decrease**, it is substituted for labor, leading to a decline in the number of **middle managers and clerical workers**.
*   IT also substitutes for other expensive forms of capital, such as buildings and machinery.

### B. Transaction Cost Theory
Information technology helps firms contract in size because it reduces **transaction costs**—the costs incurred when a firm buys on the marketplace what it cannot make itself.
*   By lowering the cost of participating in the market, IT makes it worthwhile for firms to **contract with external suppliers (outsourcing)** instead of using internal sources.
*   As transaction costs fall, the firm's size (number of employees) should theoretically shrink, as it becomes cheaper to outsource work rather than hiring employees for vertical integration.

### C. Agency Theory
IT can reduce **internal management costs**, also known as **agency costs**. Agency costs arise because owners (principals) must constantly supervise employees (agents).
*   By reducing the costs of acquiring and analyzing information, IT makes it easier for managers to oversee a greater number of employees (broadening the span of control).
*   Reducing these overall management costs allows firms to increase revenues while shrinking the number of middle managers and clerical staff.

---

## 3. Organizational and Behavioral Impacts

The sociological and behavioral impacts describe how IS reshapes the firm's structure, decision-making, and internal dynamics.

### A. Flattening Organizations
Behavioral researchers theorize that IT facilitates the **flattening of organizational hierarchies**.
*   IT broadens the distribution of information, empowering lower-level employees to make decisions without constant supervision.
*   Managers receive more accurate information more quickly, speeding up decision-making, which in turn means **fewer managers are required**. Management costs decline, and the hierarchy becomes more efficient.

### B. Postindustrial Organizations
In postindustrial societies, authority increasingly relies on **knowledge and competence** rather than merely formal position.
*   The shape of organizations flattens because professional workers tend to be **self-managing**.
*   IT may encourage task force-networked organizations where specialists come together for short periods to accomplish a specific task (e.g., designing a new automobile).

### C. Organizational Resistance to Change
Information systems inevitably become intertwined with **organizational politics** because they influence access to information—a key resource.
*   New systems often require changes in individual work routines that can be painful, requiring retraining and additional effort.
*   Because IS potentially changes an organization’s structure, culture, and strategy, there is often **considerable resistance** when they are introduced.
*   Organizational and political resistance to change is the **most common reason for the failure of large projects** to reach their objectives, not technical failure.

---

## 4. The Impact of the Internet and Digital Technologies

The Internet, especially the World Wide Web, has magnified these impacts by increasing the accessibility, storage, and distribution of information and knowledge for organizations.
*   The Internet is capable of dramatically lowering both **transaction and agency costs** facing most organizations.
*   For instance, a large firm can deliver internal operating manuals to distant employees by posting them on a corporate website, saving millions in distribution costs.
*   Businesses are rapidly rebuilding key business processes based on Internet technology, leading to simpler business processes, fewer employees, and flatter organizations.

---

## 5. Negative and Social Consequences (Quality of Life)

While information systems drive efficiency and wealth, they also introduce negative social consequences and risks.

*   **Employment Changes (Job Loss):** Redesigning business processes often leads to **reengineering job loss**, resulting in millions of mid-level managers and clerical workers losing their jobs when computers replace tasks.
*   **Dependence and Vulnerability:** Businesses and governments are now **incredibly dependent** on IS, making them highly vulnerable to system failures, disasters, or security breaches.
*   **Maintaining Boundaries:** The ubiquity of computing (smartphones, laptops) weakens the traditional boundaries separating work from family and leisure, leading to employees working when they would traditionally be playing.
*   **Balancing Power:** While computing is decentralized, corporate giants like Google and Amazon dominate the collection and analysis of private information, leading to the **centralization of power** in the hands of a few private oligopolies.
*   **Rapid Change:** Efficient global markets enabled by IT reduce the social buffers that once allowed businesses years to adjust to competition, requiring them to respond to change more quickly.

In summary, the most critical positive impact of IS on organizations is its ability to create **competitive advantage** and **operational excellence** by automating processes and enabling better, real-time decisions. However, this drive for efficiency simultaneously causes dramatic structural changes—flattening management hierarchies and requiring organizations to manage the inevitable **political and cultural resistance** that accompanies such technological transformations.

***
**Analogy:** You can think of information systems impacting an organization like **introducing a blueprint for a high-speed modular skyscraper into a traditional brick-and-mortar construction company.**
*   The blueprint (IS) drastically changes the *economics*—allowing cheaper, faster construction (lower transaction costs/agency costs) and substituting cranes (IT) for manual labor.
*   The *structure* changes—fewer supervisors are needed (flattening).
*   But the *behavioral* impact is the hardest: older workers resist the new modular methods, leading to delays (organizational resistance), and the company must completely retrain its entire workforce (organizational change) just to implement the new efficiency.


This question asks for a definition of Business Intelligence and a detailed explanation of two crucial analytical components: Predictive Analytics and Big Data Analytics.

Here is the comprehensive answer drawing upon the materials provided:

---

## 1. Definition of Business Intelligence (BI)

**Business Intelligence (BI)** is a contemporary term referring to the **data and software tools** designed for **organizing, analyzing, and providing access to data** to help managers and other enterprise users make more informed decisions.

BI systems focus specifically on **delivering information to support management decision making**. The fundamental concept behind BI and **Business Analytics (BA)** is the integration of all information streams produced by a firm into a single, coherent enterprise-wide set of data.

BI systems seek to deliver **accurate, nearly real-time information** to decision-makers. The supporting infrastructure typically includes databases, data warehouses, data marts, Hadoop, and analytic platforms.

**Business Analytics (BA)** is often defined as a vendor-defined term focusing more specifically on the **tools and techniques** for analyzing data, such as online analytical processing (OLAP), statistics, models, and data mining. BA is the use of statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning techniques to analyze data and make data-driven decisions for future outcomes.

### BI and Analytics Capabilities

Business Intelligence systems deliver six main analytic functionalities:

1.  **Production reports:** Predefined reports based on industry-specific needs.
2.  **Parameterized reports:** Users enter parameters to filter data and isolate impacts.
3.  **Dashboards/scorecards:** Visual tools displaying performance data defined by users.
4.  **Ad hoc query/search/report creation:** Allows users to create customized reports.
5.  **Drill down:** The ability to move from a high-level summary to a more detailed view of data.
6.  **Forecasts, scenarios, models:** Includes linear forecasting, what-if analysis, and standard statistical tools.

---

## 2. Predictive Analytics

**Predictive analytics** is an important capability within business intelligence analytics.

### Detailed Explanation:

1.  **Definition and Mechanism:** Predictive analytics involves the use of **statistical analysis, data mining techniques, historical data, and assumptions about future conditions** to predict future trends and behavior patterns (or outcomes of events).
2.  **Modeling Process:** This process identifies variables that can be measured to predict future behavior, such as age, gender, and driving record for an insurance policy. These predictors are combined into a predictive model for forecasting future probabilities with an acceptable level of reliability.
3.  **Relationship to Data Mining:** Predictive applications are intrinsically linked to **data mining**, which provides insights by **finding hidden patterns and relationships in large databases and inferring rules from them to predict future behavior**. *Classification* is a data mining technique used to discover the characteristics of customers likely to leave (churn) and provide a model to predict who those customers are. *Forecasting*, another type of information provided by data mining, uses a series of existing values to estimate the future value of continuous variables, such as sales figures.
4.  **Applications and Business Value:** Predictive analytics are incorporated into many BI applications across sales, marketing, finance, fraud detection, and healthcare.
    *   **Finance/Fraud Detection:** The best-known application is **credit scoring** (processing data to determine likelihood of timely payments). Credit card companies use predictive analytics to identify customers at risk for leaving.
    *   **Marketing:** Companies use it to predict customer response to direct marketing campaigns, enabling them to bypass customers less likely to respond and focus resources on promising groups, thereby lowering marketing and sales costs.
    *   **Operations:** FedEx uses models to predict customer responses to price changes and new services.

---

## 3. Big Data Analytics

**Big Data** represents datasets with **volumes so huge** that they are beyond the ability of typical relational database management systems (DBMS) to capture, store, and analyze.

### Detailed Explanation:

1.  **The Challenge of Big Data:**
    *   **Volume and Velocity:** Big data often refers to data in the **petabyte and exabyte range** (billions to trillions of records). These data are produced in much larger quantities and much more rapidly than traditional data.
    *   **Diversity (Unstructured/Semi-structured):** Big data includes non-traditional formats such as Web traffic, social media content (tweets, status messages), machine-generated sensor data, complex Web server logs, and unstructured audio/video data. Traditional relational DBMS are not well-suited for organizing and analyzing this data.
2.  **Analytical Purpose:** Businesses are interested in big data because it can reveal more patterns and interesting anomalies than smaller data sets, potentially providing new insights into customer behavior, weather patterns, or financial market activity. Big Data Analytics helps businesses extract value from these large datasets, uncover insights from diverse sources (e.g., social media, IoT), and make **real-time decisions**.
3.  **Key Technologies for Analysis:** Organizations need new tools to manage and analyze big data along with traditional enterprise data. The key technologies forming the business intelligence infrastructure for big data include:
    *   **Hadoop:** An open source software framework that allows for the distributed parallel processing of massive amounts of data across inexpensive computers. It breaks a large problem into sub-problems, processes them simultaneously, and combines the results. Hadoop can process structured, loosely structured, and unstructured data.
    *   **In-Memory Computing:** This technology relies on a computer’s main memory (RAM) rather than disk storage for data storage, eliminating data retrieval bottlenecks and dramatically shortening query response times. This allows complex business calculations to be completed within seconds.
    *   **Analytic Platforms:** These are specialized high-speed hardware-software systems (like IBM Netezza and Oracle Exadata) optimized for analyzing large datasets using both relational and non-relational technology.
4.  **Applications:** Major online companies such as Walmart, Netflix, and eBay analyze big data from customer transactions and social media streams to create **real-time personalized shopping experiences**, resulting in higher customer spending and retention rates. The British Library partnered with IBM to use a solution built atop the **Hadoop framework** to archive and analyze vast amounts of unstructured Web data.

### Diagram Context

While no single diagram is provided showing only these two concepts, the sources highlight how they fit within the larger BI structure:

The graphic **"BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYTICS FOR DECISION SUPPORT"** (Figure 12.3) illustrates that the foundation is the **Business Intelligence Infrastructure** (Databases, Data Warehouses, Data Marts). The **Business Analytics Toolset** sits above this foundation, using tools like **Statistical models** and **Data mining**. Predictive Analytics and Big Data Analytics rely heavily on these analytical models and the ability to process large, diverse datasets from the Business Environment.


That is a great set of questions covering critical MIS concepts in strategy, e-business, and ethics. Here are the comprehensive answers based on the provided sources, structured for your exam:

## 4. Explain strategic business objectives of information system in brief.

Information systems (IS) are essential tools that businesses invest in heavily to achieve **six major strategic business objectives**. These objectives are crucial for competitive advantage and survival in the modern economy.

The six strategic business objectives are:

1.  **Operational Excellence:** Businesses continually aim to improve the **efficiency** of their operations to achieve higher profitability. IS and technology are the key tools for reaching higher levels of efficiency and productivity in business operations. For example, Walmart uses its advanced inventory system to track products in real time, reducing costs and waste.
2.  **New Products, Services, and Business Models:** IS enables firms to create new products, services, and entirely new ways of doing business. A **business model** describes how a company produces, delivers, and sells a product or service to create wealth. For instance, Netflix replaced DVD rentals with an online streaming service, and Apple transformed music distribution with the iPod, iTunes, and iPad/iPhone platforms.
3.  **Customer and Supplier Intimacy:** Knowing customers well and serving them optimally leads to return business, increasing revenues and profits. Similarly, closer relationships with suppliers help lower costs. Amazon, for example, uses AI to recommend products based on customer preferences, while Walmart digitally links suppliers to its stores to ensure continuous product flow.
4.  **Improved Decision Making:** Managers often operate in a "fog of confusion" when relying on guesses and forecasts. IS provides **real-time data** from the marketplace, enabling managers to make faster, more accurate, and timely decisions. Banks, for instance, use fraud detection systems to instantly block suspicious transactions.
5.  **Competitive Advantage:** Achieving the above objectives helps firms perform better than competitors, leading to a competitive advantage. This means doing things better than rivals, charging less for superior products, and responding faster to customers and suppliers. Uber's use of mobile apps and GPS to beat traditional taxi services is an example.
6.  **Survival:** Firms often adopt IS simply as a **necessity of doing business**, driven by industry-level changes or governmental regulations. For example, banks must use cybersecurity systems to protect customer data, and many pieces of legislation in healthcare and finance impose significant information retention and reporting requirements, necessitating the use of IS.

**(This question is answered concisely to fit a mark allocation.)**

## 5. Define e-commerce. Compare e-commerce with e-business.

### Definition of E-commerce

**E-commerce** (Electronic Commerce) is the **part of e-business** that specifically refers to the **buying and selling of goods and services over the Internet**.

More formally, e-commerce involves **digitally enabled commercial transactions** (exchange of value, e.g., money, for products and services) between and among organizations and individuals, typically occurring over the Internet and the Web. E-commerce also includes supporting activities such as advertising, marketing, customer support, security, delivery, and payment related to those market transactions.

### Comparison of E-commerce and E-business

| Feature | E-business (Electronic Business) | E-commerce (Electronic Commerce) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Refers to the **use of digital technology and the Internet to execute all major business processes in the enterprise**. | Refers specifically to the **buying and selling of goods and services online**. |
| **Scope** | **Broader** scope; encompasses all internal and external operations of the firm. | **Narrower** scope; is a **subset** or component of e-business. |
| **Activities Included** | Includes e-commerce **plus** internal management, coordination with suppliers and partners, supply chain management, customer service, and online marketing. | Primarily includes **market transactions** (sales) and related activities like advertising, payment, and delivery. |
| **Focus** | Internal management and operations, improving efficiency across the entire value chain. | External transactions, generating revenue through the exchange of money for products/services. |

**In summary:** E-business utilizes digital technology across the entire enterprise, including its internal processes, while **E-commerce is focused solely on the aspect of buying and selling** that takes place digitally.

## 6. What are five moral dimensions of the information age?

The major ethical, social, and political issues raised by information systems are grouped into **five moral dimensions** of the Information Age:

1.  **Information Rights and Obligations:** This dimension concerns the rights that individuals and organizations possess with respect to themselves, particularly the claim of individuals to **privacy** and freedom from surveillance or interference. This involves questions like who can collect, store, and share personal data, and whether individuals have control over their data (e.g., GDPR).
2.  **Property Rights and Obligations:** This focuses on how **traditional intellectual property rights** (such as patents, copyrights, and trade secrets) will be protected in a digital society. Digital media is easily replicated and transmitted, making the tracing of ownership and accounting for rights difficult.
3.  **Accountability and Control:** This dimension addresses **who can and will be held accountable and liable for the harm done** to individual and collective information and property rights. With AI, automation, and IT systems making decisions, it can be unclear whether developers, companies, or users are responsible when harm or failure occurs.
4.  **System Quality:** This dimension requires establishing the **standards of data and system quality** needed to protect individual rights and the safety of society. Poorly designed software or system errors can cause security breaches, financial losses, or even life-threatening risks, necessitating high reliability and security standards.
5.  **Quality of Life:** This dimension examines the **values that should be preserved** in an information- and knowledge-based society, and the potential negative consequences of systems. This includes issues such as employment (job loss due to automation), social isolation, digital divide (unequal access to technology), rapid change, and dependence/vulnerability on systems.


This is an excellent final set of questions that covers critical topics in ethics, strategy, enterprise systems, and emerging technology.

Here are the detailed answers based on the provided source material:

## 7. What is copyright? Explain.

**Copyright** is a statutory grant designed to protect the **creators of intellectual property**.

### Explanation

*   **Protection Period:** Copyright protects against a work being copied by others for any purpose during the **life of the author plus an additional 70 years** after the author’s death. For corporate-owned works, protection lasts for **95 years after their initial creation**.
*   **Purpose:** The intent is to **encourage creativity and authorship** by ensuring that creative people receive the financial and other benefits of their work.
*   **Scope of Works:** Congress has extended copyright protection to various tangible forms of expression, including **books, periodicals, lectures, musical compositions, motion pictures, and software program code**.
*   **Limitation:** Copyright protects against the copying of **entire programs or their parts**. However, the crucial limitation is that copyright protects only the *manifestation* (the expression) of the work, and **not the underlying ideas** behind a work. Consequently, a competitor could use the same concepts and build new software without infringing the copyright.
*   **Legal Context:** Copyright is one of the three legal traditions (along with trade secrets and patent law) used to protect intellectual property. The **Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998** provides additional protection by making it illegal to circumvent technology-based protections of copyrighted materials.

## 8. What are the challenges posed by strategic information system?

Implementing **strategic information systems (SIS)** presents several key challenges for management because these systems often change the fundamental nature of the organization and competition.

The major challenges include:

1.  **Organizational Change and Resistance:** Adopting strategic systems generally requires extensive **organizational change** in business goals, processes, and relationships with customers and suppliers. This transition, known as a **strategic transition**, can be **difficult and painful to achieve**.
2.  **Lack of Sustainable Competitive Advantage:** The competitive advantages conferred by strategic systems **do not necessarily last long**. Competitors can often **retaliate and copy** these systems quickly. Consequently, systems originally intended to be strategic often become **tools for survival**, required just to stay in business.
3.  **High Costs and Complexity:** Strategic systems are often **expensive to build**. They are integrated into core firm processes, requiring precise coordination of technology, organization, and management for successful implementation.
4.  **Risk of Strategic Inhibition:** Strategic systems may sometimes **inhibit organizations** from making necessary strategic changes later on if markets, customer expectations, or technology shift rapidly.

---

## 9. What is the business value of enterprise system?

**Enterprise Systems (ES)**, also known as **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems**, provide substantial business value primarily by integrating and coordinating the firm’s internal processes.

The key benefits include:

1.  **Operational Excellence and Efficiency:**
    *   **Integration and Automation:** ES integrate core business processes (like accounting, finance, HR, sales, and production) into a single software system backed by a **centralized database**. This integration reduces manual work by **automating repetitive tasks** and eliminating duplicate data entry.
    *   **Standardization:** Large companies use ES to **enforce standard practices and data** across many operating units worldwide, ensuring everyone does business the same way and allowing the firm to leverage its global buying power.
2.  **Improved Decision Making:**
    *   ES provide **real-time data access** (up-to-the-minute) on sales, inventory, and production to management, enabling more accurate sales and production forecasts.
    *   Data captured by ES have **common, standardized definitions** accepted across the entire organization, improving the quality and consistency of management analysis.
3.  **Customer Satisfaction and Responsiveness:**
    *   Because the system integrates order and manufacturing data, firms can **respond rapidly to customer requests** for information or products.
4.  **Scalability and Flexibility:**
    *   ES can support business growth and allow organizations to **scale operations** and modify processes without significant infrastructure changes.

## 10. What is cloud database? What are the benefits of using cloud database to store data?

### What is a Cloud Database?

A cloud database refers to **database products available as cloud computing services**. These are cloud-based data management services provided by vendors like Amazon (SimpleDB, RDS), Oracle (Database Cloud Service), and Microsoft (SQL Azure Database).

A cloud environment provides access to a shared pool of computing resources (including storage and applications) over a network, typically the Internet, which can be accessed on an as-needed basis from any connected device or location.

### Benefits of Using Cloud Databases

Using cloud databases provides several business advantages, particularly for small- to medium-sized businesses and startups:

1.  **Cost Savings (Utility Computing):** Organizations using public clouds **do not have to make large investments** in their own hardware and software. Instead, they pay only for the computing services and storage capacity they actually use, often referred to as **utility computing** or **on-demand computing**.
2.  **Scalability and Elasticity:** Cloud resources demonstrate **rapid elasticity**, meaning computing resources (like storage or processing power) can be rapidly provisioned, increased, or decreased to meet **changing user demand** (e.g., handling peak system loads during major sales).
3.  **Accessibility and Flexibility:** The databases can be accessed ubiquitously using standard network and Internet devices, including **mobile platforms**, from any location.
4.  **Reduced Management Costs:** Deploying databases on a consolidated private cloud or public cloud enables IT departments to **reduce capital and operating costs** by consolidating servers and storage.

## 12. Write short notes on [2.5+2.5]

### a. Quality of Life

The **Quality of Life** dimension addresses ethical concerns regarding the values and institutions considered essential to life in an information society. It examines how information technology affects fundamental aspects of life, including **jobs, education, and mental health**.

Key issues related to quality of life include:

*   **Employment:** IS often leads to **reengineering job loss**, resulting in clerical workers and mid-level managers losing their jobs due to automation.
*   **Dependence and Vulnerability:** Businesses, governments, and associations are **highly dependent** on information systems, making society vulnerable to system failures or security breaches.
*   **Digital Divide:** This refers to the large disparity in access to computers and the Internet among different social groups.
*   **Maintaining Boundaries:** The ubiquity of mobile platforms weakens the boundary between **work and family/leisure**.
*   **Health Risks:** Information systems can lead to issues like **Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI)** and **technostress**.

### b. Customer relationship management system (CRM)

**Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems** are major enterprise applications designed to help firms achieve **customer intimacy** by coordinating all the business processes surrounding a firm's customers.

**Functionality and Value:**

*   **Customer-Focused Processes:** CRM software consolidates and coordinates customer-facing business processes, including sales, marketing, and customer service. This involves managing leads, tracking customer interactions, and setting objectives for employee performance.
*   **Data and Analytics:** CRM stores detailed **customer data** and interactions, enabling businesses to analyze customer behavior and preferences.
*   **Business Benefits:** The business value of CRM includes **improved customer relationships**, leading to higher satisfaction; **increased sales and revenue** by helping close deals; and **more efficient marketing strategies** through targeted promotions.
*   **Technology Trend:** CRM systems are increasingly utilizing **cloud computing** (Software as a Service - SaaS) and adding **social networking capabilities** (Social CRM) to enhance collaboration and interaction with customers.
