- Enterprise application development involves incorporating modern technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) into legacy systems
- This integration enhances performance, scalability, and security while allowing businesses to leverage existing investments

## Business-IT Communication Gaps

**Collaboration Challenges**
- Effective communication between business and IT teams is crucial for success, but communication gaps can lead to delays, rework, and inefficient resource use
- These gaps often arise from differences in language, priorities, and understanding of business requirements

**Solutions Through Agile**
- Organizations should adopt agile development methodologies like Scrum or Kanban to bridge communication divides
- These methodologies promote collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement, ensuring both teams are aligned toward common goals

## Adapting to Agile Development

**Cultural Transformation Requirements**
- Adapting to agile development requires a significant cultural shift within an organization
- It involves breaking down silos, empowering teams, and embracing change
- For enterprise application development teams, adopting agile methodologies means being able to respond quickly to changing business requirements, improve software quality, and reduce time-to-market

# Knowledge Management Systems in Business

## What is Knowledge Management?

**Knowledge Management (KM)** is the process of identifying, organizing, storing and disseminating information within an organization. It is a vital component of business strategy, providing a structured approach to managing information.

When knowledge is not easily accessible within an organization, it can be incredibly costly to a business as valuable time is spent seeking out relevant information versus completing outcome-focused tasks. A knowledge management system (KMS) harnesses the collective knowledge of the organization, leading to better operational efficiencies.

## Types of Knowledge

Knowledge management encompasses three distinct types of knowledge that are largely distinguished by the codification of information:

### Tacit Knowledge
**Tacit knowledge** is typically acquired through experience, and it is intuitively understood. As a result, it is challenging to articulate and codify, making it difficult to transfer this information to other individuals. Examples of tacit knowledge include language, facial recognition, or leadership skills.

### Implicit Knowledge
**Implicit knowledge** is information that has yet to be documented. While tacit knowledge is difficult to codify, implicit knowledge does not necessarily have this problem. Instead, implicit information tends to exist within processes, and it can be referred to as "know-how" knowledge.

### Explicit Knowledge
**Explicit knowledge** is captured within various document types such as manuals, reports, and guides, allowing organizations to easily share knowledge across teams. This type of knowledge is perhaps the most well-known and examples include knowledge assets such as databases, white papers, and case studies. This form of knowledge is important to retain intellectual capital within an organization as well as facilitate successful knowledge transfer to new employees.

## Knowledge Management Process

Effective knowledge management systems typically go through three main steps:

### Knowledge Creation
During this step, organizations identify and document any existing or new knowledge that they want to circulate across the company.

### Knowledge Storage
During this stage, an information technology system is typically used to host organizational knowledge for distribution. Information may need to be formatted in a particular way to meet the requirements of that repository.

### Knowledge Sharing
In this final stage, processes to share knowledge are communicated broadly across the organization. The rate in which information spreads will vary depending on organizational culture. Companies that encourage and reward this behavior will certainly have a competitive advantage over other ones in their industry.

## Knowledge Management Tools and Systems

Organizations utilize a variety of tools to reap the benefits of knowledge management:

### Document Management Systems
**Document management systems** act as a centralized storage system for digital documents, such as PDFs, images, and word processing files. These systems enhance employee workflows by enabling easy retrieval of documents, such as lessons learned.

### Content Management Systems (CMS)
**Content management systems (CMS)** are applications which manage web content where end users can edit and publish content. These are commonly confused with document management systems, but CMSs can support other media types, such as audio and video.

### Intranets
**Intranets** are private networks that exist solely within an organization, which enable the sharing of enablement, tools, and processes within internal stakeholders. While they can be time-consuming and costly to maintain, they provide a number of groupware services, such as internal directories and search, which facilitate collaboration.

### Wikis
**Wikis** can be a popular knowledge management tool given their ease of use. They make it easy to upload and edit information, but this ease can lead to concerns about misinformation as workers may update them with incorrect or outdated information.

### Data Warehouses
**Data warehouses** aggregate data from different sources into a single, central, consistent data store to support data analysis, data mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning.

# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the effort to develop computer-based systems that can behave like humans, with the ability to learn languages, accomplish physical tasks, use a perceptual apparatus, and emulate human expertise and decision making.

## Types of AI

### Expert Systems
**Expert systems** are intelligent techniques for capturing tacit knowledge in a very specific and limited domain of human expertise. These systems capture the knowledge of skilled employees in the form of a set of rules in a software system that can be used by others in the organization.

**Components:**
- **Knowledge base** - Collection of facts, rules, and relationships
- **Inference engine** - Strategy used to search through the rule base
- **User interface** - Allows users to interact with the system

**Examples of use:**

### Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)
**Case-based reasoning** represents organizational intelligence by finding and applying solutions to new problems based on past successful solutions stored in a database. The system searches for stored cases with problem characteristics similar to the new one, finds the closest fit, and applies the solutions of the old case to the new case.

**How it works:**
- User describes the problem
- System searches database for similar cases
- System finds closest matches
- System applies solutions from past cases to new problem
- System modifies solution if needed
- Successful solutions are stored for future use

**Examples:**
- Customer service applications
