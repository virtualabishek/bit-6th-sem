  # Globalization Challenges and Opportunities: A Flattened World

## The "Flat World" Concept

In 2005, journalist Thomas Friedman introduced the concept that the world was now "flat," meaning that the Internet and global communications had greatly reduced the economic and cultural advantages of developed countries[2]. This globalization presents both challenges and opportunities for business firms[2].

## Key Drivers of Globalization

**Internet & Telecommunications**: The emergence of the Internet into a full-blown international communications system has drastically reduced the costs of operating and transacting business on a global scale[1].

**24/7 Global Operations**: 
- Customers can shop anytime, anywhere for virtually anything[1]
- Companies can operate from any geographic location around the world[1]
- Jobs can move across states or oceans easily[1]

## Impact on Trade & Economy

**Growing International Dependence**:
- 33% of U.S. economy depends on imports/exports (2012)
- Over 50% in Europe and Asia
- Many Fortune 500 firms derive half their revenues from foreign operations
- Example: 85% of Intel's 2011 revenues came from overseas sales

**Manufacturing Shifts**:
- 80% of toys sold in U.S. are manufactured in China
- 90% of PCs made in China use American chips (Intel/AMD)

## Challenges for Businesses

### 1. **Labor Cost Competition**
Labor costs vary widely among countries, with developed countries paying higher wages and fringe benefits, making business costs higher[1]. Many labor-intensive industries have moved operations to countries with low labor costs, facilitated by IT[1].

### 2. **Job Displacement**
- U.S. lost several million manufacturing jobs to offshore locations in past decade
- About 300,000 service jobs move offshore annually (in normal years)
- Jobs affected include: architecture, financial services, call centers, consulting, engineering, radiology

### 3. **Competitive Pressure**
Businesses face competition from highly educated, motivated populations in low-wage areas in less-developed countries[2].

## Opportunities for Businesses

### 1. **Market Access**
Companies can reach customers worldwide without physical presence in every location[1]

### 2. **Cost Reduction**
Firms can find low-cost suppliers and manage production facilities globally, achieving extraordinary cost reductions

### 3. **Service Replication**
Internet service firms (Google, eBay) can replicate business models in multiple countries without redesigning expensive IT infrastructure

### 4. **New Job Creation**
- U.S. economy creates 3.5+ million jobs yearly (in non-recessionary years)
- Employment in information systems and service occupations is expanding
- Wages remain stable

## Strategic Implications

**For Students/Workers**: Develop high-level skills through education and experience that cannot be outsourced[2]

**For Businesses**: Avoid markets for goods and services that can be produced offshore much less expensively[2]

**Key Success Factor**: Information systems enable globalization - firms that successfully use IS to adapt to the global environment thrive[2]

## The Bottom Line

Globalization creates a "flattened" playing field where geographic boundaries matter less, but competition intensifies. Success depends on leveraging information technology strategically while developing capabilities that provide competitive advantage in the global marketplace.

# Strategic Business Objectives of Information Systems

## Overview

Business firms invest heavily in information systems to achieve six strategic business objectives[1][2][3]. There is a growing interdependence between a firm's ability to use information technology and its ability to implement corporate strategies and achieve corporate goals[1].

## The Six Strategic Business Objectives

### 1. **Operational Excellence**

Businesses continuously seek to improve the efficiency of their operations in order to achieve higher profitability[1]. Information systems and technologies are some of the most important tools available to managers for achieving higher levels of efficiency and productivity in business operations, especially when coupled with changes in business practices and management behavior[1].

**Examples**[1]:
- **Walmart** - Achieved $460 billion in sales through Retail Link system
- **UPS** (United Parcel Service) - Created largest network
- **Motorola** - Achieved Six Sigma quality standards

---

### 2. **New Products, Services, and Business Models**

Information systems and technologies are a major enabling tool for firms to create new products and services, as well as entirely new business models[1][2]. A business model describes how a company produces, delivers, and sells a product or service to create wealth[1].

**Examples**[1][6]:
- **Apple Inc.** - Transformed music distribution from vinyl/CDs to online iTunes platform with iPod technology
- **Netflix** - Changed entertainment delivery model
- **Walmart** - Introduced new retail business models

---

### 3. **Customer and Supplier Intimacy**

When a business really knows its customers and serves them well, customers generally respond by returning and purchasing more, which raises revenues and profits[1][6]. Likewise with suppliers: the more a business engages its suppliers, the better the suppliers can provide vital inputs, which lowers costs[1][4].

**Examples**[1][6]:
- **Walmart** - Uses Retail Link system that digitally links suppliers to every store, ensuring continuous product flow
- **Ritz-Carlton Hotels** - Uses CLASS (Customer Loyalty Anticipation Satisfaction System) to track guest preferences
- **High-end Hotels** - Use computers to track customer preferences and customize environments
- **JCPenney** - Links sales records to contract manufacturers so they know immediately how many replacement items to make and in what styles, colors, and sizes

---

### 4. **Improved Decision Making**

Information systems and technologies have made it possible for managers to use real-time data from the marketplace when making decisions[1][4]. Previously, managers did not have access to accurate and current data and relied on forecasts, best guesses, and luck, which resulted in raising costs and lost customers[1].

A very important prerequisite of strategic planning is to provide the right information at the right time to the right person for making an informed decision[4].

**Tools Used**[1]:
- Decision Support Systems (DSS) - For structured, unstructured, and semi-structured problems

---

### 5. **Competitive Advantage**

Doing things better than your competitors, charging less for superior products, and responding to customers and suppliers in real time all add up to higher sales and higher profits that your competitors cannot match[1]. When organizations achieve operational excellence, new products/services, customer and supplier intimacy, and improved decision-making, they are more than likely to have achieved competitive advantage[2].

**Examples**[1]:
- **Dell Computers** - Most efficient producer of PCs in the world
- **Walmart** - Most efficient retail store in the industry; created largest retail chain
- **UPS** - Created largest network

---

### 6. **Survival**

Firms also invest in information systems and technologies because they are necessities of doing business[1]. Information systems are not a luxury—in most businesses, information systems and technology are core to survival[1].

**Example**[1]:
- **Citibank** - First banking firm to introduce ATMs, gaining major competitive advantage. Other banks had no choice but to provide ATM services to remain competitive and survive in the retail banking industry

---

## Interconnection Between Objectives

When organizations achieve one or more of the first four strategic business objectives—operational excellence, new products/services/business models, customer and supplier intimacy, and improved decision-making—they are more than likely to have achieved competitive advantage[2].

---

## Why These Objectives Matter

Strategic business objectives are used to achieve greater efficiency, innovation, and customer service; they frequently change the way a business works and support entirely new business models[8]. Digital businesses are far more flexible since they can sense and react to their environment much faster than traditional businesses[5].

---

## Key Takeaway for Your Exam

**Remember**: These six objectives are **interconnected**. Success in achieving the first four objectives (operational excellence, new products/services, customer/supplier intimacy, and improved decision-making) typically leads to competitive advantage and ultimately ensures organizational survival in today's competitive business environment! 📊💼

# What is an Information System?

## Two Perspectives on Information Systems

### 1. **Technical Perspective (Definition)**

An information system can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that **collect (or retrieve), process, store, and distribute information** to support:
- Decision making
- Coordination
- Control in an organization
- Analysis of problems
- Visualization of complex subjects
- Creation of new products

### 2. **Business Perspective (Definition)**

From a business perspective, an information system provides a **solution to a problem or challenge** facing a firm and represents a combination of:
- Management elements
- Organization elements  
- Technology elements

---

## Key Concepts: Data vs. Information

### **Data**
- Streams of **raw facts** representing events occurring in organizations or the physical environment
- **Before** they have been organized and arranged into a form that people can understand and use

### **Information**
- Data that have been **shaped into a form** that is meaningful and useful to human beings
- Processed, organized data that provides meaning

### **Example: Supermarket**
- **Data**: Millions of pieces from bar code scans describing each product
- **Information**: 
  - Total number of bottles of dish detergent sold at a particular store
  - Which brands were selling most rapidly
  - Total amount spent on that brand at that store or sales region

---

## Three Basic Activities of Information Systems

Information systems produce the information that organizations need through three activities:

### 1. **Input**
- Captures or collects **raw data** from within the organization or from its external environment
- Example: Airline bookings, hotel reservations, weather data, video camera images

### 2. **Processing**
- Converts raw input into **meaningful form**
- Example: Calculating projected attendance, wait times for rides, analyzing patterns

### 3. **Output**
- Transfers the processed information to the **people who will use it** or to the activities for which it will be used
- Example: Reports showing number of guests, average wait times, revenue figures

### **Plus: Feedback**
- Output that is **returned to appropriate members** of the organization
- Helps them evaluate or correct the input stage
- Creates a continuous improvement loop

---

## Example: Disney World Crowd Control System

**Input:**
- Airline bookings data
- Hotel reservation data
- Satellite weather data
- Historic attendance data
- Video camera images from throughout the park

**Processing:**
- Calculate projected total attendance
- Calculate wait times for each ride
- Identify overcrowded vs. spare capacity attractions
- Determine which rides can add capacity

**Output:**
- Number of guests on specific days/times
- Average wait time per ride
- Average restaurant/shop visits
- Average rides per day per guest
- Average spending per customer

**Feedback:**
- Management uses this to gauge efficiency and profitability
- Adjustments made to staffing, pricing, operations

---

## Important Distinction: Computer vs. Information System

### **Computers & Software Are NOT the Same as Information Systems**

**Analogy: Building a House**
- **Hammers, nails, wood** = Tools and materials
- **House** = Architecture, design, setting, landscaping, decisions

Similarly:
- **Computers and programs** = Hammers, nails, lumber (the tools)
- **Information System** = Complete solution including organizational processes, people, and decisions

### **What Makes a Complete Information System:**

**Technology Components:**
- Computer hardware (physical equipment)
- Computer software (detailed instructions)
- Data management technology
- Networking/telecommunications technology

**Plus Non-Technology Components:**
- People who use the system
- Organizational processes
- Management decisions
- Business objectives

---

## Components of Information Systems

Information systems contain information about significant **people, places, and things** within the organization or in the environment surrounding it.

### **Required Elements:**
1. **Hardware** - Physical devices
2. **Software** - Programs and instructions
3. **Data** - Raw facts to be processed
4. **People** - Users and IT specialists
5. **Processes** - Procedures and workflows
6. **Networks** - Communication infrastructure

---

## Why Understanding IS Matters

To fully understand information systems, you must understand:
- The **problems** they are designed to solve
- Their **architectural and design elements**
- The **organizational processes** that lead to solutions
- The broader **organizational, management, and technology dimensions**

---

## Information Systems Literacy vs. Computer Literacy

### **Computer Literacy**
- Focuses primarily on knowledge of **information technology**
- Technical skills with hardware and software

### **Information Systems Literacy**
- Broader understanding encompassing:
  - Management dimensions
  - Organizational dimensions
  - Technical dimensions
- Understanding how IS provides solutions to business challenges

---

## Key Takeaway for Your Exam

**Remember the Formula:**

**Information System = Technology + People + Processes + Organization**

It's NOT just computers! An information system is a **complete solution** that:
1. Takes in data (Input)
2. Processes it into useful information (Processing)
3. Delivers results to decision-makers (Output)
4. Improves continuously (Feedback)

All while supporting organizational goals and solving business problems! 💻📊🎯



# Dimensions of Information Systems

## Overview

To fully understand information systems, you must understand the broader dimensions of your organization, management, and information technology in your system, along with your power to provide solutions to challenges and problems in the enterprise environment[3].

## How the Three Dimensions Work Together

**The Integration Model**:

```
Technology (Hardware, Software, Networks, Data)
        ↓
    +---+---+
    |       |
Organization ← → Management
(Processes,      (Planning,
Structure,       Leadership,
Culture)         Decisions)
    |       |
    +---+---+
        ↓
Information System Solution
```

# Business Perspective on Information Systems

## Definition

From a business perspective, an information system provides a **solution to a problem or challenge** facing a firm and provides **real economic value to the business**[8]. The decision to build or maintain an information system assumes that the returns on this investment will be superior to other investments in buildings, machines, or other assets[8].

---

## Key Business Objectives of Information Systems

### **Creating Value for the Firm**

Information systems are an important instrument for creating value for the firm[4]. From a business perspective, information systems are part of a series of **value-adding activities** for acquiring, transforming, and distributing information that managers can use to improve decision making, enhance organizational performance, and ultimately increase firm profitability[4].

### **Primary Purpose**

The primary purpose of information systems is to contribute to **corporate value**[4]. The value of an information system to a business, as well as the decision to invest in any new information system, is largely determined by the extent to which the system will lead to:
- Better management decisions[4]
- More efficient business processes[4]
- Higher firm profitability[4]

## Business Benefits of Information Systems

### **1. New Products and Services**

Any company looking to improve and secure the future has to establish a broader perspective with the use of a well-designed and coordinated information system[1]. The IS makes it easier to analyze independent processes such as information to produce valuable products or services and organized work activities[1]. Therefore, an IS can give a company the competitive advantage by analyzing how a company creates, produces, and sells their products or services[1].

### **2. Information Storage**

Every organization needs records of its activities to find the cause of problems and proper solutions[1]. Information systems are useful for storing operational data, communication records, documents, and revision histories[1]. Manual data storage will cost the company lots of time, especially when it comes to searching for specific data[1].

A quality information system stores data in a comprehensive and sophisticated database which makes the process of finding it much more convenient[1]. With such information, a company can analyze how certain actions affected the business, as well as prepare cost estimates and forecasts[1].

### **3. Easier Decision Making**

Without an information system, a company can take a lot of time and energy in the decision-making process[1]. However, with the use of IS, it's easier to deliver all the necessary information and model the results to make better decisions[1]. The management team can use the information system to choose the best course of action and carry out the tasks[1].

When there are several appealing alternatives, the information system can be used to run different scenarios by calculating key indicators such as costs, sales, and profits[1]. This way, you can determine the alternative with the most beneficial results[1].

### **4. Behavioral Change and Communication**

Employers and employees can communicate rapidly and more effectively with an information system[1]. While emails are quick and effective, the use of Information Systems is more efficient, since documents are stored in folders that can be shared and accessed by employees[1].

Information flows from the management to lower-level employees and vice versa[1]. Also, the lower-level employees get enlightened and involved in important decision making, and this eliminates the need for middle managers[1]. Employees who are directly involved in the decision-making process are motivated and dedicated to their tasks[1].

### **5. Automation and Resource Optimization**

The automation of routine tasks frees up human resources, allowing them to focus on more strategic activities that add value to the business[6]. In today's data-driven landscape, the ability to make well-informed decisions swiftly is crucial for business success[6]. Information systems provide a robust framework for the collection, processing, and analysis of data, converting raw data into actionable insights[6].

## Competitive Advantage Through Information Systems

### **How IS Creates Competitive Advantage**

In today's continuously changing and fast-moving world, customers' requirements and preferences are always evolving[1]. The only businesses that can hope to remain competitive and continue to function at the performance levels that match their customers' expectations are those that embrace innovation[1].

In the recent past, any business success has been pegged on the information technology quality that the business has employed and the capability to correctly use such information[1]. Information systems (IS) importance has increased dramatically, and most businesses have been prompted to introduce it to keep their competitive edge[1]. Today, nobody can envisage a business without an effective digital information system[1].

### **Real-World Example: Uber**

Uber is a ride-hailing company that was founded in San Francisco, California in 2009[5]. The company's core business model is to connect passengers with drivers through a mobile app, making it easy for people to get around cities quickly and affordably[5].

Uber's competitive advantage is built on its ability to harness the power of Information Systems to create a user-friendly platform that connects drivers and passengers in real-time[5]. The company uses this data to optimize its service, improve driver and passenger experiences, and make informed decisions about its

### Academic Disciplines Used to Study Information Systems

The study of information systems draws from multiple academic disciplines[7]:

**Technical Approach Disciplines:**
- **Computer Science** — provides the technical foundation for understanding system design and implementation, including programming, algorithms, and data structures[7]
- **Management Science and Operations Research** — contribute formal models and system capabilities[7]

**Behavioral Approach Disciplines:**
- **Psychology** — helps understand how individuals interact with and are affected by information systems[7]
- **Sociology** — examines how groups and societies interact with technology and its social impact[7]
- **Economics** — contributes to understanding business impacts and resource allocation[7]

**Additional Disciplines:**
- **Business Administration** — provides insights into how information systems support business processes and organizational performance[1]
- **Information Science** — studies the collection, organization, and dissemination of information[1]

### Sociotechnical Systems Perspective

The **sociotechnical systems (STS) perspective** emphasizes the interplay between social and technical elements in information systems[1]. Key points:

- It recognizes that technology and social factors (organizational structure, culture, human behavior) are **interconnected and influence each other**[1]
- The approach highlights that both **technical and social aspects must be considered together** when developing and managing information systems[1]
- Organizations consist of people producing products/services using technology, where **each affects the operation and appropriateness of the other**[8]

This perspective ensures information systems are effective and successfully integrated within organizations[1].

Good luck on your exam!
