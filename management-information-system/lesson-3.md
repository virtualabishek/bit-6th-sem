# Porter's Competitive Forces Model and Dealing with Competitive Forces using Information Systems - Revision Notes

## Porter's Competitive Forces Model

### Overview
- **Framework Purpose** - Understanding competitive forces at work in an industry and how economic value is divided
- **Origin** - First described by Michael Porter in 1979 Harvard Business Review article
- **Revolutionary Impact** - Started a revolution in the strategy field and continues to shape business practice
- **Application** - Helps assess industry attractiveness, trends, and competitive positioning

### The Five Competitive Forces

#### 1. **Threat of New Entrants**

**Definition and Impact:**
- New entrants can force current players to keep prices down and spend more to retain customers
- Entry brings new capacity and pressure on prices and costs
- Puts a cap on the profit potential of an industry

**Barriers to Entry:**
- Economies of scale
- Cost of building brand awareness
- Accessing distribution channels
- Government restrictions
- Capabilities of potential entrants
- Well-established companies in other geographic regions increase threat

#### 2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**

**Definition and Impact:**
- Powerful suppliers can charge higher prices or demand more favorable terms
- Lowers industry profitability through negotiating leverage
- Companies purchase various inputs from suppliers at differing proportions of cost

**Factors Increasing Supplier Power:**
- Only one or two suppliers of essential input products
- Expensive or time-consuming to switch suppliers
- Limited supplier alternatives
- High switching costs

#### 3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**

**Definition and Impact:**
- Powerful customers can force prices down or demand more service at existing prices
- Buyers capture more value for themselves using their clout
- Can play rivals against each other

**Factors Increasing Buyer Power:**
- Buyers are large relative to competitors serving them
- Products are undifferentiated
- Products represent significant cost for buyer
- Few switching costs to shift business between competitors
- Price trumps quality considerations
- Multiple buyer segments may exist with different power levels

#### 4. **Threat of Substitute Products or Services**

**Definition:**
- A substitute is another product/service meeting the same underlying need in a different way
- Examples: Videoconferencing substitutes for travel, email substitutes for express mail

**Threat Level Factors:**
- Attractive price-performance trade-off versus industry's product
- Low buyer cost of switching to substitute
- Availability of alternative solutions

#### 5. **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors**

**Definition and Impact:**
- Intense rivalry drives down prices or dissipates profits by raising cost of competing
- Companies compete away the value they create

**Factors Intensifying Rivalry:**
- Competitors are numerous or roughly equal in size and market position
- Industry growth is slow
- High fixed costs creating incentives for price cutting
- High exit barriers
- Rivals highly committed to the business
- Firms have differing goals, diverse approaches, or lack familiarity with each other

### Key Concepts of Industry Structure

**Fundamental Principles:**
- Every industry is different, but underlying drivers of profitability are the same
- Five Forces determine competitive structure and profitability
- Industry structure and company's relative position are two basic drivers of profitability
- Analyzing Five Forces helps anticipate shifts in competition
- Can shape how industry structure evolves
- Helps find better strategic positions within industry

**Dynamic Nature:**
- Industry structure changes over time and is not static
- Buyers or suppliers can become more or less powerful over time
- Technological or managerial innovations affect entry or substitution likelihood
- Changes in regulation affect rivalry intensity or barriers to entry
- Competitor choices (pricing, distribution) affect competition path
- Five Forces analysis essential to anticipate and exploit structural change

### Model Strengths and Applications

**Utility:**
- Very useful for identifying competitive forces
- Suggests generic strategies for competition
- Helps determine intensity of competition and potential profitability
- Assists in understanding where power lies in sector
- Identifies opportunities and navigates threats
- Helps craft differentiated value propositions

**Strategic Uses:**
- Assess which industries to compete in
- Position companies for success
- Anticipate shifts in competition
- Shape industry structure evolution
- Find better strategic positions

### Model Limitations and Critiques

**Criticisms:**
- **Not Very Specific** - Doesn't provide detailed methodology to achieve competitive advantages
- **Too Static** - Doesn't apply well to quick-changing markets
- **Static Assessment** - Situational analyses need updating as industry realities constantly evolve
- **Limited Applicability** - Meant to critique perfectly competitive models, unlike real-world markets
- **Lacks Analytical Detail** - Not specific about what to do accurately

**Recommended Approach:**
- View five forces as ever-present market shapers rather than fixed metrics
- Regular updates needed for changing industry realities
- Consider technology, regulations, consumer preferences as change drivers
