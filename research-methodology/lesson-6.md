# Unit 6: Measurement and Scaling

## I. Concept of Measurement

**Measurement** is defined as the **process of assigning numbers, labels, or symbols to objects or observations** according to a specified rule of correspondence. It is a fundamental process in research that allows for the systematic collection, quantification, and analysis of data, which aids in understanding, comparing, and making decisions.

### Key Aspects of Measurement

*   **Process:** Measurement involves mapping properties of objects (the domain) onto numerals or symbols (the range) according to some rule. The rule itself is known as the **scale**.
*   **Difficulty:** Measuring abstract concepts (such as intelligence, motivation, social conformity, or attitudes) is significantly more complex and demanding than measuring physical objects (like height or weight) because the concepts are often abstract, and the measurement tools may not be standardized. Consequently, confidence in the accuracy of results is lower in such cases.
*   **Purpose:** Knowing the level of measurement helps researchers decide how to interpret the data and what **statistical analysis** is appropriate.

## II. Different Levels of Measurement

Measurement scales are typically classified into four types based on their mathematical properties, proceeding from the least precise (nominal) to the most precise (ratio).

### 1. Nominal Scale

*   **Definition:** This is the **lowest level of measurement** and is used simply to classify or categorize objects or events, often by assigning number symbols or labels to distinguish them.
*   **Properties:** The numbers are labels only, possess **no numerical meaning**, and their order is of no consequence.
*   **Data Characteristics:** Nominal data are counted data. The only possible arithmetic operation is counting members in each group.
*   **Statistics:** The appropriate measure of central tendency is the **mode**.
*   **Examples:** Gender (Male, Female), Blood Type (A, B, AB, O), or numbering basketball players for identification.

### 2. Ordinal Scale

*   **Definition:** The lowest level of ordered scale, which places items in a meaningful **rank order** (e.g., highest to lowest or lowest to highest).
*   **Properties:** It indicates a relationship of 'greater than' or 'less than'. However, it **does not measure the exact differences** or intervals between the ranks.
*   **Data Characteristics:** The real difference between adjacent ranks may not be equal.
*   **Statistics:** The appropriate measure of central tendency is the **median**. Non-parametric statistical tests are typically used.
*   **Examples:** Student's rank in class, movie ratings (1 star, 5 stars), or customer satisfaction levels (e.g., very satisfied, satisfied).

### 3. Interval Scale

*   **Definition:** This scale includes all the characteristics of nominal and ordinal scales. It orders the data, and the **intervals/gaps between units are equal** based on some rule.
*   **Properties:** A major limitation is the **lack of a true or absolute zero point**; the zero is arbitrary.
*   **Data Characteristics:** Allows for addition and subtraction of scores (differences are measurable), but ratios (multiplication and division) are not meaningful.
*   **Statistics:** Provides more powerful measurement, allowing the use of the **mean** for central tendency and **standard deviation** for dispersion. Common significance tests are the *t* test and *F* test.
*   **Examples:** Temperature measured on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scale, or IQ scores.

### 4. Ratio Scale

*   **Definition:** The **most powerful and highest level of measurement**, possessing all the properties of the nominal, ordinal, and interval scales.
*   **Properties:** It has an **absolute or true zero point**, which indicates the complete absence of the property being measured.
*   **Data Characteristics:** Since ratios have significance, **all customary arithmetic operations** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) can be applied.
*   **Statistics:** Generally, all statistical techniques are usable.
*   **Examples:** Measures of physical dimensions such as **weight, height, distance**, and financial measures like income.

## III. Measurement of Variables in Likert Scales

The **Likert scale** is a specific type of **summated rating scale**. It is extremely popular for measuring subjective concepts like **opinions, attitudes, or behaviors**.

### Mechanism and Procedure

1.  **Statements:** The scale consists of a number of statements expressing either a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward a specific object.
2.  **Response:** The respondent reacts to each statement by indicating their level of **agreement or disagreement**. The scale usually employs **five or seven degrees** of response.
3.  **Scoring:** Each response point is assigned a numerical score (e.g., 5 for the most favorable, 1 for the least favorable).
4.  **Total Score:** The scores across all statements are totaled, and the overall score measures the respondent’s position on the continuum of favorable-unfavorableness toward the issue.

### Scale Types and Limitations

*   **Common Format:** A common format is the five-point scale, providing options like Strongly Agree, Agree, Undecided (Neutral), Disagree, and Strongly Disagree.
*   **Ordinal Limitation:** Despite the numerical scoring, the Likert scale generally does not rise above the stature of an **ordinal scale** because there is **no assurance that the intervals between the five positions are equally spaced** (e.g., the interval between 'Strongly agree' and 'Agree' may not equal the interval between 'Agree' and 'Undecided').

## IV. The Issue of Validity and Reliability in Research

Sound measurement instruments must meet the tests of **validity, reliability, and practicality**. Validity and reliability are the two primary considerations in evaluating a measurement tool.

### A. Validity

**Validity** is the **most critical criterion** of sound measurement. It refers to the degree to which a test measures **what we actually wish to measure**.

#### Types of Validity:

1.  **Face Validity:** This refers to the extent to which a test appears to measure what it claims to measure, based merely on **face value** or subjective judgment. It is considered the weakest and simplest form of validity.
2.  **Content Validity:** The extent to which a measurement instrument provides **adequate coverage of the entire topic or concept** under study. Its determination is primarily judgmental and intuitive, often requiring a panel of experts.
3.  **Criterion-Related Validity:** Evaluates how accurately a test measures or predicts an external outcome (criterion).
    *   **Predictive Validity:** Refers to the test's usefulness in **predicting some future performance**.
    *   **Concurrent Validity:** Refers to the test's usefulness in **closely relating to other measures of known validity** (when the test scores and criterion variables are obtained simultaneously).
4.  **Construct Validity:** The degree to which a measure accurately assesses the underlying theoretical concept or construct it is intended to measure. Constructs are typically abstract ideas (like self-esteem or motivation).
    *   **Convergent Validity:** Checks if measures of the same or similar constructs correspond to each other.
    *   **Discriminant Validity:** Checks if your measurement differentiates or does not correlate highly with tools that measure something theoretically different.

#### Issues with Validity

Validity can be compromised by issues such as:
*   **Unclear concepts:** If the concept being measured is vaguely defined.
*   **Incomplete coverage:** When the measurement doesn't fully represent all aspects of the concept.
*   **External influences:** Factors like mood or environmental distractions affecting responses.
*   **Inappropriate selection of constructs or measures**.

### B. Reliability

**Reliability** refers to the **accuracy and precision** of a measurement procedure. A measuring instrument is reliable if it provides **consistent results**. Reliability is essentially the consistency, uniformity, stability, and dependability of the measurement.

#### Reliability and Validity Relationship

*   A **valid instrument is always reliable**.
*   However, a **reliable instrument need not be a valid instrument** (e.g., a scale that consistently overweighs objects by five kgs is reliable but not a valid measure of weight).

#### Types of Reliability

1.  **Test-Retest Reliability (Stability):** Measures consistency by securing results from **repeated measurements of the same person using the same instrument** at different times.
2.  **Equivalent or Parallel-Forms Reliability (Equivalence):** Checks consistency by comparing results from **two different but similar versions of a test** given to the same group.
3.  **Split-Half Method (Internal Consistency Reliability):** Divides a single test into halves and correlates the scores to check if all items logically measure the same underlying concept.
4.  **Inter-Rater or Inter-Observer Reliability:** Checks for consistency between the observations or ratings made by **two or more different investigators or people**.

#### Issues with Reliability

Reliability issues can arise from:
*   **Inconsistent results over time**.
*   **Observer differences** when interpreting the same situation.
*   **Unrelated questions** in a test that do not measure the same core concept.
*   **Poor test design,** such as a test being too short, too easy, or too hard.
*   **Transient factors** like fatigue or boredom that interfere with consistent responses.

*Analogy:*
You can think of **Reliability** and **Validity** like aiming at a target.
*   **Reliability** is like having a tight cluster of arrows, hitting the same spot every time, regardless of whether that spot is the bullseye.
*   **Validity** is hitting the actual intended target (the bullseye).
*   If your measurement is both reliable and valid, your arrows are tightly clustered *on the bullseye*.
