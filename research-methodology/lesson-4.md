# Unit 4: Review of Literature (10 Hrs.)

## I. Concept of Review of Literature (RoL)

The **Review of Literature (RoL)** is the consultation of **previous studies** related to the area of the proposed study. It is defined as a **body of text** that critically reviews the essential points of current knowledge and methodological approaches concerning a specific topic. An RoL is an **objective, critical summary** of published research literature relevant to a topic.

### Nature and Purpose of Review of Literature

The review of literature is considered a **secondary source** because it does not report any new or original experimental work.

**The importance and functions of an RoL include:**
*   **Widens the researcher's vision** in the subject matter of the study.
*   Provides a **solid foundation of background knowledge** for the research.
*   **Prevents duplication** of previous work.
*   Assists in **refining the statement of the problem**.
*   Familiarizes the researcher with **various methodologies** and approaches adopted in the field.
*   Helps resolve any **contradictory findings or gaps** in previous studies.
*   Leads the way forward for further research.
*   Identifies the **key variables** related to the topic.
*   Helps the researcher **justify the reason for the research** and defend its importance.
*   It ensures that the research fits into the existing body of knowledge and allows the researcher to learn from previous theory.
*   The review provides evidence to show that the researcher is **knowledgeable** in the proposed study area.

## II. Process of Reviewing Books, Journal Articles, and Reports

The research process dictates that an **extensive literature survey** must be undertaken once the problem is formulated. This involves an intensive search or study of past writings.

### Outline of the Literature Review Structure

A typical literature review, which can be presented as a small report based on review work, generally consists of the following components:

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   It should contain a **concise definition of the topic** under consideration (which may be descriptive or argumentative).
    *   The **scope** of the related literature being investigated should be stated (e.g., published or unpublished works, works in English, works from a particular period).
    *   **Intentional exclusions** should be noted.
    *   The introduction should state the **general findings** of the review and comment on the availability of sources.

2.  **Main Body:**
    *   Sources can be organized using **chronological or thematic approaches**.
    *   Each work should be **critically summarized and evaluated** for its premise, methodology, and conclusion.
    *   It is crucial to address **inconsistencies, omissions, and errors** in previous work, just as it is to identify accuracy, depth, and relevance.
    *   The use of **logical connections and transitions** is required to link sources.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    *   The conclusion must **summarize the key findings** of the review in general terms.
    *   It should note commonalities between works, whether favorable or not.
    *   This section serves as the opportunity to **justify a research proposal**; thus, the research idea should be clearly re-stated and supported by the findings of the review.

### Note Taking and Recording Process

For effective review work, keeping **entire and exact records and references** of what is read is essential. The researcher must learn the required citation style.

*   **Source Cards:** Record cards are used for making notes from literature and documents. In each card, only **one note** (for a single case or topic) should be written down.
*   **Information to Record for a Book:** Author’s name, date of publication, title, edition, place of publication, publisher, volumes, and page numbers.
*   **Information to Record for a Serial Publication (Journal):** Author's name, date of publication, title of the article, name of the serial publication, volume and number, and page number.

## III. Citation and Referencing

**Referencing** is the standard procedure for **acknowledging sources** of information used in research. **Citation** is the style of managing this information in the research report.

### Overview of Different Formats

The reference materials are listed at the last part of the research report. Globally recognized standard referencing or citing systems include:

*   **American Psychological Association (APA) style** (widely used in social sciences, education, and business).
*   The Harvard System.
*   The Manual of style of the University of Chicago (Chicago Style).
*   The Modern Languages Association System (MLA style, widely used in language research).
*   The ACS Style Guide.
*   Numeric System (e.g., ISO690).

### Citation of Books, Reports, Journal Articles in APA Format

APA style requires **parenthetical citations** within the text rather than endnotes or footnotes, typically consisting of the author’s name and year of publication.

#### A. In-Text Citation Rules (APA)

1.  **Indirect Quotation/Paraphrase:** The author’s surname and year of publication appear in the body of the report. *Example:* Shrestha (2000) stressed that business firms must think globally.
2.  **Direct Quotation:** The author's surname, year of publication, and page number must be included, usually at the end within inverted commas. *Example:* “Hypothesis testing is called deductive research” (Wolff & Pant, 2006, p 14).
3.  **Two Authors:** The surname of both authors is cited.
4.  **Two or More Authors (First Citation):** Cite all authors. Subsequently, include only the surname of the first author followed by **“et. al”**.
5.  **Multiple Sources Cited Together:** The citations should be in **alphabetical order** of the first author’s surname, separated by semicolons.

#### B. References Page Rules (APA)

The reference list is an alphabetized list of sources cited in the paper. All citations must be in the **Hanging Indent Format**.

| Source Type | General Format (Example) | Citation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Book (Single Author)** | Kotler, P. (1998). *Marketing management: Analysis, planning, implementation and control*. New Delhi: Prentice – Hall of India. | Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work in italics* (Edition). Location: Publisher. |
| **Book (Two Authors)** | Pant, P.R. & Wolff.K. (2002). *Social Science Research and Thesis Writing*. Kathmandu: Buddha Publication. | List both authors. |
| **Journal Article (Print)** | Pant, P.R.(1993). Human resource development: A cross-country overview of the Asian region. *The Nepalese Management Review, 3*(1), 1-13. | Author(s). (Year). Title of article (No italics). *Name of the Journal in italics*, *Volume* (*Number*), Page number(s). |
| **Corporate/Institutional Report** | CBS (1998). *Census of manufacturing establishments, national level 1996-97.* HMG, Kathmandu, Nepal: Central Bereau of Statistics. | Corporate Author. (Year). *Title of work* (Edition). Location: Author/Publisher. |

## IV. Research Tools and Technology

### Use of Resources (Books, Encyclopedias, Academic Databases, etc.)

A wide range of sources are used to develop the literature review. These resources include:
*   **Books**
*   **Scholarly journals**
*   **Encyclopedias**
*   **Handbooks/information**
*   Previous research papers, conference proceedings, theses, and empirical studies.
*   Government reports and commercial reports.

In the initial step of the research process (extensive literature survey), the researcher should consult **abstracting and indexing journals** and academic databases.

### Use of Reference Management Software (e.g., Zotero/Mendeley)

Researchers should use reference management tools, such as **Ref-works**, to manage references and create bibliographies. This practice makes the task of making a bibliography, citing, or referencing sources less tedious.

### Paper Formatting (e.g., LaTeX/MS Office)

The mechanics of writing a research report require adherence to specific formatting rules:
*   The manuscript should be written on unruled paper, 8 1/2″ × 11″ in size.
*   A margin of at least one and one-half inches should be allowed on the left, and at least half an inch on the right.
*   If typed, all text should be **double-spaced** on one side of the page only (except for long quotations, which are single-spaced and indented).
*   In APA style, double spacing is required throughout the text and references.

### Plagiarism Detection (e.g., iThenticate Software)

**Plagiarism** is the act of presenting another researcher or author’s language, ideas, thoughts, or expressions as one’s own original work without full acknowledgment. It is considered a serious ethical offense in academia and industry.

Researchers should utilize **Plagiarism Checkers** or specialized software to detect copying.

**Types of Plagiarism**:
*   **Global plagiarism:** Passing off an entire text by someone else as your own work.
*   **Verbatim plagiarism:** Directly copying someone else’s words without quotation marks and citation.
*   **Paraphrasing plagiarism:** Rephrasing someone else’s ideas but presenting them as your own without citation.
*   **Patchwork plagiarism (or "patchwork"):** Stitching together parts of different sources to create a new text, often by merely replacing words with synonyms.
*   **Self-plagiarism:** Recycling your own past work without citation.

**How to Avoid Plagiarism:**
*   **Quote directly** and use **quotations marks** when using someone else's exact words, along with an in-text citation.
*   When **paraphrasing**, rewrite the sentence in your own words while retaining the original idea, and **still cite the source**.
*   Add **original insights** to demonstrate understanding beyond merely combining source information.
*   Include a **reference page** (bibliography) at the end of the paper to acknowledge all sources.
*   Use a **plagiarism checker**.
