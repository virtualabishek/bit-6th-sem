# Unit 2: Research Design (6 Hrs.)

## I. Concept of Research Design and its Importance

### Concept of Research Design

A **research design** is the **arrangement of conditions** for the collection and analysis of data in a manner that aims to combine **relevance to the research purpose** with **economy in procedure**. It is the overall **plan** or **blueprint** researchers select to carry out their study.

**Research design** is the **conceptual structure** within which research is conducted. It constitutes the blueprint for the collection, measurement, and analysis of data.

More explicitly, the research design includes an outline of what the researcher will do from writing the hypothesis to the final analysis of data.

**The design decisions happen to be in respect of:**
1.  What is the study about?
2.  Why is the study being made?
3.  Where will the study be carried out?
4.  What type of data is required?
5.  Where can the required data be found?
6.  What periods of time will the study include?
7.  What will be the sample design?
8.  What techniques of data collection will be used?
9.  How will the data be analyzed?
10. In what style will the report be prepared?

The overall research design can be split into parts: the **sampling design**, the **observational design**, the **statistical design**, and the **operational design**.

### Importance and Need of Research Design

Research design is needed because it facilitates the smooth sailing of research operations.

*   It helps **minimize time and money** expenditure.
*   It helps to **minimize bias** and **marginal error**.
*   It ensures the **validity and reliability** of the study.
*   It allows for advance planning to **avoid flaws**.
*   It ensures the **selection of appropriate tools**.
*   It provides a blueprint for the collection of **relevant evidence** to answer the initial question as **unambiguously as possible**.
*   It helps the researcher **organize his ideas** in a form where flaws and inadequacies can be identified.
*   It helps in **monitoring expenditure** through budget allocation, preventing waste of funds.

## II. Features of a Good Research Design

A good design is often characterized by being **flexible, appropriate, efficient, and economical**.

**Key Features include:**

1.  **Minimizing Bias and Maximizing Reliability:** A good design generally minimizes bias and maximizes the **reliability of the data** collected and analyzed.
2.  **Maximal Information/Comprehensiveness:** It should provide an opportunity for considering **many different aspects** of a problem and yield maximal relevant information.
3.  **Control of Extraneous Variables:** It should help to **minimize the influence or effect of extraneous variable(s)**.
4.  **Clarity and Objectives:** It should provide **clear objectives** and be consistent with the **purpose or objective** of the research problem.
5.  **Statistical Precision:** It should have **statistical precision**. The design giving the **smallest experimental error** is generally considered the best in many investigations.
6.  **Feasibility:** It must consider the **time and budget** constraints.
7.  **Generalizability:** A design is generalizable if the outcome is **applicable on a bigger population** from which the sample is selected.
8.  **Flexibility:** While descriptive/diagnostic designs are rigid, exploratory designs **must be flexible** to permit the consideration of many different aspects of a phenomenon as they arise.

## III. Types of Research Designs

Research designs are typically categorized based on their primary function: **Exploration, Description, or Hypothesis Testing (Experimentation)**.

### 1. Exploratory Research Design (Formulative Studies)

**Concept and Objective:**
*   Exploratory research is conducted for a problem that has **not been clearly defined**.
*   Its main purpose is **formulating a problem** for more precise investigation or **developing working hypotheses**.
*   The major emphasis is on the **discovery of ideas and insights**.
*   Exploratory studies provide detailed explanations of phenomena that are **less known**.

**Features and Methodology:**
*   The research design appropriate for exploratory studies must be **flexible**.
*   It is **less structured** and **more flexible**.
*   There is often **no pre-planned design for analysis**.
*   Methods include the **survey of concerning literature**, the **experience survey**, and the **analysis of ‘insight-stimulating’ examples**.
*   Exploratory research often relies on **qualitative approaches** like in-depth interviews, focus groups, case studies, or pilot studies.

**Limitations:**
*   The results are **not usually useful for decision-making by themselves**.
*   They are **not typically generalizable to the population at large**.
*   They provide **qualitative data** which can be **judgmental and biased** to interpret.
*   It does **not provide definitive answers** or actionable solutions.

### 2. Descriptive Research Design (and Diagnostic Studies)

**Concept and Objective:**
*   Descriptive research is used to **obtain information concerning the current status** of the phenomena to describe **"what exists"**.
*   The objective is to **portray accurately the characteristics** of a particular individual, situation, or group.
*   It aims to answer the **"who, what, when, where and how"** questions of the subject under study. Diagnostic research determines the **frequency** with which something occurs or its **association** with something else.

**Features and Methodology:**
*   The design for descriptive/diagnostic studies must be **rigid and not flexible**.
*   It is characterized by **prior formulation of the hypotheses**.
*   The design must ensure protection against bias and **maximize reliability**.
*   It often uses **structured instruments** for data collection.
*   Descriptive research is **well structured** and tends to be **rigid**.
*   Descriptive studies can be longitudinal (over an extended period to observe changes and trends) or cross-sectional (data collected at a single point in time).

**Limitations:**
*   Descriptive research **cannot identify cause and effect relationships**.
*   It cannot necessarily seek to explain relationships, test hypotheses, or make predictions.
*   The findings are specific to the time and place of study, limiting universal applicability.

### 3. Experimental Research Design (Hypothesis-Testing Studies)

**Concept and Objective:**
*   Experimental research studies test the **hypotheses of causal relationships between variables**.
*   It is an attempt by the researcher to **maintain control over all factors** that may affect the result.
*   The aim is to determine or predict **what may occur**.
*   The researcher **manipulates one variable** (independent variable) and controls/randomizes the rest.

**Key Components and Types:**
*   **Experimental Group:** The group that **receives the experimental treatment** or manipulation.
*   **Control Group:** Used for **comparison**, this group is not exposed to the experimental variable or receives a standard treatment.
*   **Manipulation:** The researcher **does something** to one group of subjects.
*   **Randomization:** Subjects are **randomly assigned** to control and experimental groups, giving each an equal chance of assignment.
*   Experimental designs include informal designs (like before-and-after without control) and formal designs (like Completely Randomized Design, Randomized Block Design, Latin Square Design, and Factorial Designs). Types also include **Pre-experimental**, **True Experimental** (with random assignment), and **Quasi-experimental** (used when random assignment isn't possible).

**Application and Limitations:**
*   **Application:** Experimental research is essential when time is an important factor in establishing a cause-and-effect relationship, or when there is an invariable behavior between cause and effect.
*   **Advantages:** It clearly shows **cause-and-effect relationships**. Results are repeatable and reliable due to random assignment and control groups.
*   **Limitations:** Experiments can be **expensive** and **time-consuming**. Results may not reflect real-life situations if conducted in a lab. There are **ethical issues** if the treatment involves dangerous conditions.

## IV. Specialized Research Methods

### Quantitative and Qualitative Research

| Feature | Quantitative Research | Qualitative Research |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Based on the **measurement of quantity** or amount. Focused on **numbers and statistical analysis** to measure data. | Concerned with **qualitative phenomena**, kind, or quality. Focused on **understanding concepts, opinions, or experiences through words**. |
| **Objective** | To measure and test relationships or patterns in data. | To explore and understand **deeper meanings or insights**. |
| **Methodology** | Uses **structured methods** like surveys, experiments, or questionnaires. | Uses **unstructured methods** like interviews, focus groups, or observations. |
| **Application** | Applicable to phenomena that can be expressed in terms of quantity. Used to **generalize results to wider populations**. | Important in behavioral sciences to discover **underlying motives**. |

### Empirical Research

**Empirical research** relies on **experience or observation alone**. It is **data-based research** where conclusions are capable of being verified by observation or experiment. It is also known as the **experimental type of research**. In empirical research, the researcher actively seeks facts firsthand to prove or disprove a working hypothesis.

### Case Study

**Concept and Definition:**
*   A case study is a method of **exploring and analyzing the life of a social unit**, such as a person, a family, an institution, a cultural group, or an entire community.
*   It is a study in **depth rather than breadth**.
*   It involves the **intensive investigation** of the particular unit under consideration.
*   The approach is primarily **qualitative**.
*   The objective is to understand the **complex factors** operative within a social unit as an **integrated totality**.

**Applications and Types:**
*   The case study method is indispensable for **therapeutic and administrative purposes**.
*   Case studies result in **fruitful hypotheses** regarding the social unit.
*   Types include **Exploratory Case Studies** (to develop hypotheses) and **Hypothesis Testing Case Studies** (to test the validity of a relationship).

**Limitations of Case Study:**
*   **False Generalization:** Conclusions are based on **one or a few social units** and cannot necessarily be generalized to all cases in a given population.
*   **Time-Consuming and Expensive:** Case studies involve studying the natural history cycles of social units minutely, requiring **more time** and lot of **expenditure**.
*   **Bias:** Case data are often vitiated by the **personal biases** or preconceived notions of the researcher, especially if they develop deep support for the subject.
*   It is **not appropriate** if important and essential variables (cause and effect) are **already clearly identified**.

## V. Concept of Dependent and Independent Variables

A **variable** is a concept that can take on different quantitative values. Examples include weight, height, or income.

1.  **Independent Variable (Explanatory/Causal Variable):**
    *   This is the variable that is **antecedent** to the dependent variable.
    *   It is the variable that the researcher **manipulates or changes** to observe its effect.
    *   *Example:* If height depends on age, **age** is the independent variable. In an experimental study on plant growth, the **amount of sunlight** (e.g., 4, 6, 8 hours) is the independent variable.

2.  **Dependent Variable (Criterion/Resultant Variable):**
    *   This variable **depends upon or is a consequence** of the independent variable.
    *   It is the variable that is **observed and measured** to see the effect of the independent variable.
    *   *Example:* If height depends on age, **height** is the dependent variable. In a study on plant growth, the **height of the plant** (growth in cm) is the dependent variable.

### Assessment of their Relationships

When testing a hypothesis of a causal relationship between variables, a design is required that permits inferences about **causality**.

*   **Extraneous Variables:** Independent variables that are **not related to the study purpose** but may affect the dependent variable are called extraneous variables (e.g., intelligence affecting social studies achievement when the focus is on self-concept).
*   **Control:** A good research design minimizes the influence of extraneous variables, a process called **control**.
*   **Causal Relationship:** Experimental research design is specifically used to determine a **cause-and-effect relationship** between independent and dependent variables.
*   **Confounded Relationship:** If the dependent variable is **not free from the influence of extraneous variable(s)**, the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is said to be **confounded**.

## VI. Issue of Generalization of Research Findings

**Generalization** refers to the degree to which you can **apply or extend the research results** of a sample to the **whole population** or a broader context. The objective of research is to produce knowledge that can be applied as widely as possible.

**Factors Affecting Generalization (Issues and Challenges):**

1.  **Sampling Representativeness:** If the sample is **not representative** of the larger population, the findings may not be generalizable. Researchers must carefully select participants to ensure diversity and inclusivity.
2.  **Sample Size:** **Small sample sizes** may not adequately represent the diversity of a population, leading to **limited applicability** of the findings. Larger sample sizes generally contribute to good generalizability.
3.  **Research Method:** The researcher should choose research methods that are appropriate for the question and are likely to produce generalizable findings.
4.  **Context-Specific Results:** Findings from one context may **not apply to another** due to cultural, social, or environmental differences.
5.  **Time Sensitivity:** Social, economic, or technology changes over time can affect the **relevance of findings**. The dynamic nature of populations makes it difficult to generalize findings from outdated research.
