# Unit 7: Data Analysis and Report Preparation

## I. Data Presentation and Summarization

**Processing** and **Analysis of Data** are consecutive stages that follow data collection. **Processing** prepares the data (editing, coding, classification, tabulation), making it amenable to analysis. **Analysis** involves computing measures and searching for patterns and relationships.

### A. Data Presentation Techniques

1.  **Frequency Tables (Frequency Distribution)**
    *   **Classification** (grouping data based on common characteristics) is necessary because most studies yield a large volume of raw data.
    *   **Frequency distribution** is a systematic arrangement of raw data in a tabular form, which makes the information easier to understand and interpret.
    *   A table indicates the **number of observations (frequency)** within each group.

2.  **Bar Charts/Diagrams**
    *   A **Bar diagram** or **bar chart** is a visual presentation method in statistics.
    *   It uses vertical or horizontal rectangular bars whose lengths are proportional to the measure of the data they represent.
    *   A **Sub-Divided Bar Diagram** splits a bar into several proportional components, typically using different colors or shades to distinguish between them.

3.  **Pie Charts/Graphs**
    *   **Graphs and tables** may be used to reveal trends in data, but they must be explained and referred to in the accompanying text.
    *   All graphs are referred to as **'Figures'** and both axes must be clearly labeled. Figures and tables summarize, amplify, or complement the text, they do not simply repeat the information.

4.  **Percentages**
    *   Percentages are frequently used in data presentation because they **simplify numbers**, reducing all figures to a 0 to 100 range, which **facilitates relative comparisons**.

5.  **Cross Tabulations**
    *   A **cross-tabulation** is a multi-dimensional table (two or more dimensions) that records the frequency of respondents possessing specific characteristics described in the table's cells.
    *   It provides valuable information about the relationship between variables. It is often referred to as a **cross-break**.
    *   Cross-tabulation is especially useful when the data are in **nominal form**.

### B. Summary Measures (Descriptive Analysis)

**Descriptive analysis** is primarily the study of distributions of one variable (unidimensional analysis) or two (bivariate analysis) or more (multivariate analysis). The important statistical measures used to summarize data include:

1.  **Measures of Central Tendency (Statistical Averages)**: Tell us the point about which items tend to cluster.
    *   **Mean (Arithmetic Average):** The most common measure, found by dividing the total of the values by the number of items.
    *   **Median:** A positional average, commonly used for qualitative phenomena.
    *   **Mode**.

2.  **Measures of Dispersion**: Measure the scatter of the values around the average.
    *   **Variance** and **Standard Deviation** (the square root of variance) are the most frequently used.
    *   **Range** and **Mean Deviation**.

3.  **Measures of Asymmetry (Skewness)** and **Kurtosis**.

4.  **Measures of Relationship**: Such as Karl Pearson’s coefficient of correlation.

## II. Inferential Statistical Analysis (Bivariate and Multivariate)

**Inferential analysis** (or statistical analysis) is concerned with **tests of significance for testing hypotheses** and estimating population values, which is key to interpretation.

### A. Bivariate Analysis and Inferential Tests

**Bivariate analysis** is a statistical method used to determine if there is a **statistical link** between two variables, and if so, how strong and in which direction that link is.

1.  **t-test**
    *   A **t-test** is a statistical test used to **compare the means of two groups** to determine if the difference between them is significant.
    *   It is appropriate when comparing the averages of a numerical variable across two categories of a categorical variable. It is a **parametric test**.

2.  **Chi-square ($\chi^2$) Test**
    *   The **chi-square test** is a statistical method for identifying disparities between **expected** and **observed** frequencies in one or more categories.
    *   It is a significant **non-parametric test** based on frequencies (not parameters like mean or standard deviation).
    *   It is used to **test the significance of association between two attributes** or to test the goodness of fit. It helps compare categorical variables within the same sample group.

3.  **Correlations**
    *   **Correlation analysis** studies the **joint variation of two or more variables** to determine the amount of correlation between them.
    *   In bivariate population, correlation can be studied using **Karl Pearson’s coefficient of correlation** (product moment correlation coefficient). The value of 'r' lies between $\pm 1$.
    *   **Regression analysis** is a separate statistical method concerned with formulating a mathematical model to depict the **cause and effect relationship** between two or more variables, often used for prediction.

### B. Concept of Multivariate Analysis (MVA)

**Multivariate analysis** encompasses all statistical methods that **simultaneously analyze more than two variables** on a sample of observations.

*   **Objective:** To analyze the association between one criterion variable and several independent variables, or the association between variables having no dependency relationships.
*   **Significance:** MVA is important because univariate analysis, which treats variables separately, may lead to incorrect interpretations by failing to consider the **correlation or inter-dependence** among variables.
*   **Types:** MVA includes Multiple Regression Analysis, Multiple Discriminant Analysis, Multivariate Analysis of Variance (Multi-ANOVA), Canonical Correlation Analysis, and **Factor Analysis**. Factor analysis is highly utilized, especially in social and behavioral sciences, and aims to resolve a large set of measured variables into relatively few categories called factors.
*   **Challenge:** MVA often requires **complex and laborious computations** due to the large number of variables and observations needed, though the use of high-speed electronic computers has accelerated its application since the 1950s.

## III. Research Report Preparation

### A. Format of Academic Research Report

A research report conveys the results of a study, including the procedure, analysis, and interpretation. A complete research paper, typically in APA style, often contains the following sections:

1.  **Title Page** and **Abstract**.
    *   The **Title** should be brief, topic-specific, and informative.
    *   The **Abstract** is a concise summary covering the scope, purpose, methodology, summary of main findings, conclusions, and recommendations, and is typically written last.
2.  **Introduction:** Presents the problem, objectives, working hypothesis, and scope.
3.  **Methodology (Methods/Materials and Methods):** Details how the research was conducted, including the basic design, specific methods, selection/number of subjects/sample, and the statistical analysis adopted. This section is written in the past tense.
4.  **Results:** A detailed, factual summary of the findings, often using supporting data in the form of **tables and charts**. Raw data or details about statistical procedures should generally be included in the **Appendices**.
5.  **Discussion:** The section where results are interpreted, accounting for findings, and explaining their significance within the context of other research. It addresses the adequacy of sampling techniques, limitations, assumptions, and problems with data collection/analysis.
6.  **Conclusions:** A final, clear, and precise summing up of the results, often including recommendations and policy implications.
7.  **References/Bibliography:** A list of all sources consulted, which are presented at the last part of the report.
8.  **Technical Appendices:** Enlisted for all technical data, supplementary information, mathematical derivations, or elaboration on specific techniques (e.g., list of experiment stimuli, programming code, raw data).

### B. Preparation of a Mini-Research Report

When preparing a report, the researcher must adhere to standard research methodology:

*   The report should be **long enough to cover the subject** but **short enough to maintain interest**.
*   It must be written in a **concise and objective style** in simple language, avoiding vague expressions.
*   It must be **free from grammatical mistakes**.
*   The use of **charts and illustrations** should only occur if they present information more clearly and forcibly.
*   The report should reflect the **logical analysis** of the subject matter and show **originality**.
*   Calculated confidence limits and various constraints experienced should be stated.

## IV. Ethical Issues in Data Use and Reporting

**Research ethics** are the moral principles and guidelines that researchers must follow in their activities to ensure scientific competence, academic honesty, and integrity.

### A. Informed Consent and Self-Privacy

1.  **Informed Consent:** This is a process in which participants are **fully informed** about the terms and conditions of the research, including potential risks and benefits. This ensures their participation is voluntary and free from bias.
2.  **Self-Privacy and Confidentiality:**
    *   **Confidentiality** is the assurance that identifying information gathered from participants will **not be made available** to anyone not directly involved in the study.
    *   The researcher is expected to **respect and protect the privacy** and identity of participants. If a respondent feels anonymity is not assured, they may be reluctant to express certain feelings, leading to errors in measurement.
    *   Researchers must follow proper processes, especially when collecting data from **vulnerable groups** (e.g., prisoners, students), whose participation is risky.

### B. Plagiarism and Data Misconduct

1.  **Plagiarism:** Plagiarism is the act of **presenting another researcher or author’s language, ideas, thoughts, or expressions as one’s own** without crediting the source or providing full acknowledgment.
2.  **Misconduct related to data use:**
    *   **Fabrication:** Making up research outcomes or altering them to suit one’s own needs or theory.
    *   **Falsification:** Manipulating research materials, or changing or **omitting data** as per convenience so that the research record is not properly represented. This includes suppressing data so that exceptions are not considered.
    *   **Avoiding Bias:** Bias on the part of the researcher is unethical; this includes a deliberate attempt either to **hide what was found** or to **highlight something disproportionately** to its true existence.
    *   **Incorrect Reporting:** Using an appropriate methodology but reporting the findings in a way that slants them to serve personal or external interests is unethical.
