# Unit 5: Methods of Data Collection and Sampling Techniques

## I. Primary and Secondary Data

When deciding on a method of data collection, researchers consider two main types of data: primary and secondary.

| Feature | Primary Data | Secondary Data |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Data collected **afresh and for the first time**; original in character. | Data that have **already been collected and processed** by someone else. |
| **Source** | Surveys, observations, experiments, personal interviews. | Published (reports, journals, books) or unpublished (diaries, records) sources. |
| **Time/Cost** | More **time-consuming** and **expensive** due to original collection efforts. | Less time-consuming and less expensive, utilizing existing data. |
| **Suitability** | Directly related to the objectives of the current research. | May not be in the exact required form and must be checked for suitability and reliability. |

**Precautions when using Secondary Data:**
Before using secondary data, a researcher must scrutinize the data to ensure they possess the following characteristics:
1.  **Reliability of data:** Check who collected the data, the methods used, the time of collection, and whether there was any compiler bias.
2.  **Suitability of data:** Ensure the definitions and units of collection used in the original inquiry are compatible with the current research objective, scope, and nature.
3.  **Adequacy of data:** Ensure the data are sufficient for the scope of the present analysis.

## II. Methods of Collecting Primary Data

Primary data are collected either through **experiment** or through **survey**. In descriptive research/surveys, primary data can be obtained using one or more of the following methods:

1.  **Observation Method:** The researcher watches and records behavior or phenomena. This can be participant or non-participant, controlled or uncontrolled, and structured or unstructured.
2.  **Interview Method (Direct Communication):**
    *   **Direct Personal Interview:** The investigator meets the respondent personally, asks questions, and records the information. This provides accurate and reliable data but is time-consuming and expensive.
    *   **Indirect Oral Interview:** Information is collected by interviewing a third party who has knowledge of the subject, used when direct contact is difficult.
    *   **Telephone Interviews:** Contacting respondents over the phone; useful for industrial surveys where time is limited.
3.  **Mailed Questionnaire Method:** A questionnaire (a list of questions) is sent by post to respondents, who complete it and return it. This is cost-effective for large, geographically spread populations but suffers from a **low rate of return** and is only suitable for **educated and cooperating respondents**.
4.  **Collection through Schedules (Enumerators):** Enumerators (trained personnel) are appointed, visit the respondents with a schedule (proforma containing questions), and fill in the replies themselves based on the respondent’s answers. This is expensive but ensures **high accuracy** and can be used for **illiterate respondents** (e.g., population census).
5.  **Information from Local Agents/Correspondents:** Agents collect data on behalf of the researcher and send it to the central office; suitable for news media.
6.  **Other Methods:** Include warranty cards, distributor audits, pantry audits, consumer panels, use of mechanical devices, and **projective techniques** (used to uncover underlying motives/attitudes).

## III. Preparation of Questionnaire

A questionnaire is a list of questions used to gather data about attitudes, experiences, or opinions. Its success depends on careful construction.

### A. Types of Questions

Questions are classified by nature, form, and allowed response:

| Type of Question | Description/Application | Avoidance/Issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structured (Closed-Ended)** | Have definite, concrete, pre-determined questions and fixed response options (e.g., Yes/No, multiple choice). | Restricts range of data and is inappropriate for probing attitudes or exploring new ideas. |
| **Unstructured (Open-Ended)** | Allow respondents freedom to provide answers in their own words; useful for qualitative or exploratory research to gather detailed insights. | Difficult to handle, analyze, interpret, and prone to interviewer bias. |
| **Dichotomous** | A special case of structured questions with only two possible answers (e.g., Yes or No). | N/A |
| **Ambiguous** | Unclear, vague, or open to multiple interpretations; does not convey the same meaning to all respondents. | **Should be avoided** as they lead to confusion and unreliable responses. |
| **Leading** | Phrased to subtly prompt or influence the respondent toward a specific answer. | **Should be avoided** as they introduce bias. |
| **Embarrassing** | Questions about private matters (e.g., stealing, sexual behavior) that respondents may refuse to answer or distort. | **Should be avoided**. |

### B. Characteristics of a Good Questionnaire

A questionnaire must be constructed carefully to be effective. Essentials of a good questionnaire include:

1.  **Clarity and Simplicity:** Questions should be **clear, simple, and easily understood**. Complex words, technical terms (for non-technical studies), and jargon should be avoided.
2.  **Conciseness:** It should be comparatively **short** and to the point; lengthy questionnaires often find their way into the wastebasket.
3.  **Impartiality:** Questions should be **objective and impartial** in wording and should not provide any hints or suggestions (avoid leading questions).
4.  **Logical Sequence (Question Sequence):** Questions should proceed in a **logical sequence**, generally moving from **general to specific** and from easy to more difficult questions. Difficult or personal questions should be relegated toward the end.
5.  **Dichotomous/Multiple Choice:** Whenever possible, use questions that require minimum writing (closed-ended) to simplify analysis.
6.  **Pre-testing:** It should be **pre-tested** with a small group (Pilot Study/Survey) to identify and fix mistakes or unclear questions before final use.

## IV. Concept of Sampling

In most research, it is difficult to study the entire population, so a **sample** is selected to represent the whole.

| Concept | Definition | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Population (Universe)** | The **aggregate of objects, animate or inanimate,** or the total items/units in any field of inquiry about which information is desired. | Can be **finite** (fixed number of elements, e.g., population of a city) or **infinite** (theoretically impossible to observe all elements, e.g., stars in the sky). |
| **Sample** | A **smaller group (subset)** selected from the population that is used to represent the characteristics of the whole population. | Results derived from the sample are generalized to the entire population. |
| **Sampling** | The act, process, or technique of **selecting a suitable sample** from a population for the purpose of determining the characteristics or parameter of the whole. | |
| **Sampling Frame** | Also known as the **source list**. It is a complete list or database of all sampling units in the population from which the sample is to be drawn. | Must be comprehensive, correct, reliable, and representative of the population. |

## V. Sampling and Non-Sampling Error

### A. Sampling Error

**Sampling error** refers to the errors that arise on account of **sampling**—the inevitable inaccuracy due to studying only a small portion of the population rather than the whole.

*   **Nature:** Sampling errors are generally **random variations** (in case of random sampling) in sample estimates around the true population values. They occur randomly and are equally likely to be in either direction, tending to be compensatory.
*   **Magnitude:** Sampling error **decreases as the sample size increases**.
*   **Reasons:** Faulty selection of the sample (using a defective technique), substitution (replacing a hard-to-reach unit), faulty demarcation of sampling units, or variability/heterogeneity of the population.

### B. Non-Sampling Error

**Non-sampling error** occurs because of mistakes in data collection, recording data, misunderstanding questions, or processing errors.

*   **Nature:** These errors may creep in during the process of collecting actual information and occur in **all surveys** (census or sample). They are difficult to measure.
*   **Sources (Reasons):**
    1.  **Data Entry/Compiling Errors:** Mistakes made while recording, coding, tabulating, or summarizing the data.
    2.  **Respondent Errors:** Incorrect or biased responses due to misunderstanding questions, lack of interest, deliberate falsehoods (natural bias in reporting data), or memory lapses.
    3.  **Non-Response Error:** When individuals fail to respond, leading to incomplete or unbalanced data.
    4.  **Questionnaire Design Issues:** Poorly designed questions that are unclear, leading, or too complex.
    5.  **Faulty Planning/Definition:** Errors in defining objectives, or errors in measuring characteristics.

## VI. Probability and Non-Probability Sampling

Sample designs are classified based on the element selection technique: **Probability** (random selection) and **Non-Probability** (non-random or subjective selection).

### A. Probability Sampling (Random/Chance/Objective Sampling)

In probability sampling, every item/unit in the population has an **equal or known chance** of being included in the sample. This eliminates bias and allows for the estimation of sampling error.

1.  **Simple Random Sampling (SRS):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Every possible sample combination has an equal probability of being selected. Selection can be done using the **Lottery method** or **Random Number Tables**.
    *   **Application:** Used when the population is homogeneous and a complete sampling frame is available.
    *   **Types:** **With Replacement (SRSWR)** (item selected is returned) or **Without Replacement (SRSWOR)** (item selected cannot be chosen again).

2.  **Systematic Sampling:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Items are selected at **regular intervals** (every $k^{th}$ item) from a list, starting from a randomly chosen point. The sampling interval $k$ is calculated by dividing the population size ($N$) by the sample size ($n$).
    *   **Application:** Useful when a sampling frame is available in the form of a list of considerable length. It spreads the sample evenly over the entire population.

3.  **Stratified Sampling:**
    *   **Mechanism:** The population (if heterogeneous) is divided into **non-overlapping sub-populations or strata** (groups that are individually homogeneous). Items are then selected from each stratum using simple random sampling.
    *   **Application:** Essential when ensuring representation of small groups or sub-groups (e.g., gender, income levels) with specific characteristics.
    *   **Allocation:** Samples may be drawn proportionally (sample size is proportional to stratum size) or disproportionally (equal number from each stratum or optimal allocation based on variability and cost).

4.  **Cluster Sampling (Area Sampling):**
    *   **Mechanism:** The population is divided into clusters (groups, usually geographical). A random sample of clusters is selected, and **all units** within the selected clusters are typically studied.
    *   **Characteristics:** Clusters should be heterogeneous within themselves but homogeneous between clusters.
    *   **Application:** Used when the total geographical area is large, as it reduces cost and makes field work more efficient. If clusters are geographical subdivisions, it is called **Area Sampling**.

5.  **Multi-stage Sampling:**
    *   **Mechanism:** A development of cluster sampling, used for big inquiries extending over large geographical areas. Sampling is carried out in stages (e.g., selecting states, then districts within states, then towns within districts, and finally families within towns).
    *   **Application:** Easier to administer than single-stage designs because the sampling frame is developed in partial units.

### B. Non-Probability Sampling (Subjective Sampling)

Selection is based on the researcher's intuition or subjective criteria, meaning the probability of selection for each item cannot be determined. This does not allow for the estimation of sampling error.

1.  **Deliberate/Purposive/Judgment Sampling:** Selection of items is deliberate and based on the researcher’s judgment of which units are representative of the population or align with the study’s specific objectives.
2.  **Convenience Sampling:** Elements are selected based on their ease of access, availability, or proximity to the researcher. This is often used for pilot testing.
3.  **Quota Sampling:** Similar to stratified sampling, the population is segmented into sub-groups (strata), but the selection of units within each segment is left to the interviewer's judgment until a specified quota is filled. It is a form of non-probability sampling.
4.  **Snowball Sampling:** Existing subjects recruit future subjects from their acquaintances. This is useful for studying hidden populations (e.g., drug users, specific rare conditions) that are difficult for researchers to access directly.

## VII. Sample Size Estimation for Estimating Mean and Proportion

The **sample size ($n$)** must be optimum—neither too large nor too small—and large enough to provide a confidence interval of the desired width. The size is typically determined by specifying the **precision (acceptable error, $e$)** and the **confidence level (reliability, $z$)**.

**Factors Determining Sample Size:**
1.  **Precision Required ($e$):** Higher accuracy requires a larger sample size.
2.  **Confidence Level ($z$):** Higher confidence (e.g., 99% vs 95%) requires a larger $z$ value and thus a larger sample.
3.  **Nature of Universe (Dispersion):** If the population is heterogeneous (larger population variance or standard deviation $\sigma_p$), a larger sample is required.
4.  **Availability of Finance and Time**.

### A. Sample Size for Estimating a Mean ($\mu$)

When estimating the population mean, the sample size ($n$) for an infinite population is derived from the confidence interval formula:
$$
n = \frac{z^2 \cdot \sigma_p^2}{e^2}
$$
Where:
*   $n$: Sample size
*   $z$: Standard variate value (based on desired confidence level, e.g., 1.96 for 95%).
*   $\sigma_p$: Standard deviation of the population (often estimated using sample standard deviation $s$).
*   $e$: Acceptable error (desired precision).

For a **Finite Population** (where population size $N$ is known), the formula incorporates the finite population multiplier:
$$
n = \frac{z^2 \cdot N \cdot \sigma_p^2}{N e^2 + z^2 \cdot \sigma_p^2}
$$

### B. Sample Size for Estimating a Proportion ($p$)

When estimating a population percentage or proportion, the sample size ($n$) for an infinite population is given by:
$$
n = \frac{z^2 \cdot p \cdot q}{e^2}
$$
Where:
*   $p$: Sample proportion of success (best estimate of population proportion).
*   $q$: $1 - p$ (proportion of failure).
*   *Note:* If $p$ is unknown, using $p=0.5$ (and $q=0.5$) yields the most conservative (maximum) sample size.

For a **Finite Population** ($N$ known), the formula is:
$$
n = \frac{z^2 \cdot N \cdot p \cdot q}{e^2 (N-1) + z^2 \cdot p \cdot q}
$$
