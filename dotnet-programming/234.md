***

## 2. MSIL and CLR (Very Important – Asked in 2080, 2081-II)

### MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language)
- Also called CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
- CPU-independent intermediate code generated by .NET compilers
- Contains instructions for loading, storing, calling methods, exception handling
- Stored in assemblies (.dll, .exe) along with metadata[1][2]

### CLR (Common Language Runtime)
- Execution engine of .NET Framework
- Manages code execution (managed code)
- **Key services provided by CLR:**
  - **JIT Compilation**: Converts MSIL to native machine code at runtime
  - **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management
  - **Exception Handling**: Handles runtime errors
  - **Type Safety**: Ensures correct use of data types
  - **Security**: Code access security, verification
  - **Language Interoperability**: Different .NET languages work together[3][4]

### Compilation Process
```
Source Code (C#, VB) → Compiler → MSIL + Metadata (Assembly)
                                        ↓
                          CLR (JIT) → Native Machine Code → Execution
```

***

## 3. .NET CLI Commands (build, run, test, deploy)

```bash
# Create new project
dotnet new console -n MyApp       # Console app
dotnet new mvc -n MyMvcApp        # MVC web app
dotnet new webapi -n MyApi        # Web API

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run

# Run unit tests
dotnet test

# Publish for deployment
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
```

***

## Sample Question & Answer: "Explain about MSIL and CLR" [5 marks]

**Answer:**

**MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language):**
- MSIL is CPU-independent intermediate code generated when .NET source code is compiled
- It is platform-independent and stored in assemblies (.dll/.exe)
- Contains instructions for method calls, memory operations, exception handling
- Must be converted to native code before execution

**CLR (Common Language Runtime):**
- CLR is the execution engine of .NET that manages program execution
- Converts MSIL to native machine code using JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler
- Provides services like:
  - Garbage Collection (automatic memory management)
  - Exception Handling
  - Type Safety and Security
  - Cross-language interoperability

***

# UNIT 3 – HTTP and ASP.NET Core (3 Hrs.)

## 1. HTTP Basics

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**
- Stateless request-response protocol between client and server
- Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

### HTTP Request Format
```
GET /api/students HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{optional body for POST/PUT}
```

### HTTP Response Format
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 85

{"id": 1, "name": "Ram", "address": "Kathmandu"}
```

### Common Status Codes
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 | OK (Success) |
| 201 | Created |
| 400 | Bad Request |
| 401 | Unauthorized |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |

***

## 2. MVC Pattern (Very Important – Asked in 2081)

**Model-View-Controller** separates application into three components:

- **Model**: Data and business logic (e.g., `Student`, `Book` classes)
- **View**: User interface (Razor views `.cshtml`)
- **Controller**: Handles requests, interacts with Model, returns View

### MVC Flow
```
User Request → Controller → Model (data) → View → Response to User
```

### Example Answer: "Explain MVC Pattern in ASP.NET" [7 marks]

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern divides an application into three interconnected components:

**Model:**
- Represents data and business logic
- Contains classes like `Student`, `Book` with properties
- Handles data validation and database operations

**View:**
- Displays data to the user (UI layer)
- In ASP.NET Core, views are `.cshtml` files using Razor syntax
- Should not contain business logic

**Controller:**
- Handles incoming HTTP requests
- Interacts with Model to get/update data
- Selects appropriate View to render response

**Advantages of MVC:**
- Separation of concerns (easy maintenance)
- Testability (each component can be tested independently)
- Clean HTML output (full control over markup)
- Supports multiple views for same data

***

## 3. ASP.NET Core Architecture Overview

- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Middleware Pipeline**: Request passes through sequence of middleware components
- **Built-in Dependency Injection**: Services injected via constructors
- **Kestrel**: Built-in cross-platform web server
- **Configuration**: Uses `appsettings.json`, environment variables

### Project Structure
```
/Controllers    → Controller classes
/Views          → Razor view files (.cshtml)
/Models         → Data model classes
/wwwroot        → Static files (CSS, JS, images)
Program.cs      → Entry point, configure services and middleware
```

***

## Sample Question: "Define URL routing with its features. Discuss ASP.NET Core architecture." [5+5]

**URL Routing:**
URL Routing is the process by which ASP.NET Core maps incoming URLs to Controller Actions. It determines which controller and action method should handle a request.[5]

**Features of URL Routing:**
- Maps incoming requests to controller actions
- Generates outgoing URLs corresponding to actions
- Supports route parameters (e.g., `/Student/Details/5`)
- Supports route constraints and default values
- Two types: Convention-based and Attribute-based routing

**ASP.NET Core Architecture:**
- Built on modular, cross-platform design
- Uses middleware pipeline for request processing
- Built-in dependency injection container
- Kestrel as default web server
- Supports MVC, Web API, Razor Pages in unified framework
- Configuration through `Program.cs` and `appsettings.json`

# UNIT 4 – Creating ASP.NET Core MVC Applications (7 Hrs.)

## 1. Controllers and Actions (Very Important – Asked in 2081)

### Creating a Controller

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

public class StudentController : Controller
{
    // Action method - handles GET /Student/Index
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }

    // Action with parameter - handles GET /Student/Details/5
    public IActionResult Details(int id)
    {
        var student = GetStudentById(id);
        return View(student);
    }

    // POST action
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Create(Student student)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            // Save student
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
        return View(student);
    }
}
```

### Action Result Types[6][7]

| Result Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `ViewResult` | Returns HTML view | `return View();` |
| `JsonResult` | Returns JSON data | `return Json(data);` |
| `RedirectResult` | Redirects to URL | `return Redirect("url");` |
| `RedirectToActionResult` | Redirects to action | `return RedirectToAction("Index");` |
| `ContentResult` | Returns plain text | `return Content("Hello");` |
| `FileResult` | Returns file | `return File(bytes, "application/pdf");` |
| `NotFoundResult` | Returns 404 | `return NotFound();` |

***

## 2. Rendering HTML with Views – Razor Syntax[8][9]

Razor is a markup syntax for embedding C# code in HTML views.

### Basic Razor Syntax

```html
@* This is a comment *@

@{
    // Code block
    var greeting = "Welcome to ASP.NET Core!";
    var today = DateTime.Now;
}

<h1>@greeting</h1>
<p>Today is @today.DayOfWeek</p>

@* Implicit expression *@
<p>Current time: @DateTime.Now</p>

@* Explicit expression *@
<p>Result: @(5 + 10)</p>
```

### Conditionals and Loops

```html
@if (Model.Price > 1000)
{
    <p class="expensive">Premium Product</p>
}
else
{
    <p>Regular Product</p>
}

@foreach (var item in Model.Products)
{
    <li>@item.Name - Rs. @item.Price</li>
}
```

### Sample Answer: "How is rendering HTML with views done?" [5 marks]

In ASP.NET Core MVC, HTML is rendered using **Razor View Engine**. Razor allows mixing HTML with C# code using `.cshtml` files.

**Key Features:**
- `@` symbol starts C# code
- `@{ }` for code blocks
- `@expression` for inline expressions
- Supports conditionals (`@if`, `@switch`)
- Supports loops (`@for`, `@foreach`, `@while`)

**Example:**
```html
@model Student

<h2>Student Details</h2>
<p>Name: @Model.Name</p>
<p>Address: @Model.Address</p>

@if (Model.Age > 18)
{
    <p>Adult Student</p>
}
```

***

## 3. Models: Binding and Validation[10][11]

### Model Binding
Automatically maps HTTP request data (form fields, route values, query strings) to action method parameters or model objects.

```csharp
// Model
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }
}

// Controller action with model binding
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create(Student student)
{
    // student object automatically populated from form data
    return View(student);
}
```

### Model Validation
Uses Data Annotations to define validation rules.

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required")]
    [StringLength(50, ErrorMessage = "Name cannot exceed 50 characters")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string Address { get; set; }

    [Range(1, 100, ErrorMessage = "Age must be between 1 and 100")]
    public int Age { get; set; }

    [EmailAddress(ErrorMessage = "Invalid email format")]
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
```

### Checking Validation in Controller

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create(Student student)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        // Save to database
        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }
    // Return view with validation errors
    return View(student);
}
```

## 4. Dependency Injection and IOC Container (Very Important – Asked in 2081-II)

### What is Dependency Injection (DI)?
DI is a design pattern where dependencies are provided to a class rather than created inside it. This promotes loose coupling and testability.[12][13]

### What is IOC Container?
**Inversion of Control (IOC) Container** is a framework that manages object creation and dependency injection automatically.[14]

### ASP.NET Core Built-in DI Container
ASP.NET Core has built-in DI support using `IServiceCollection` and `IServiceProvider`.

**Steps:**
1. **Register** services in `Program.cs`
2. **Resolve** (inject) via constructor

### Example Code

**Step 1: Create Interface and Implementation**
```csharp
public interface IStudentService
{
    List<Student> GetAllStudents();
}

public class StudentService : IStudentService
{
    public List<Student> GetAllStudents()
    {
        return new List<Student>
        {
            new Student { Id = 1, Name = "Ram" },
            new Student { Id = 2, Name = "Shyam" }
        };
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Register Service in Program.cs**
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register service with DI container
builder.Services.AddScoped<IStudentService, StudentService>();

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();
var app = builder.Build();
```

**Step 3: Inject in Controller (Constructor Injection)**
```csharp
public class StudentController : Controller
{
    private readonly IStudentService _studentService;

    // Constructor injection
    public StudentController(IStudentService studentService)
    {
        _studentService = studentService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var students = _studentService.GetAllStudents();
        return View(students);
    }
}
```

### Service Lifetimes

| Lifetime | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AddSingleton` | Single instance for entire application |
| `AddScoped` | One instance per HTTP request |
| `AddTransient` | New instance every time requested |

***

## 5. Web API and JSON

### Creating API Controller

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class StudentsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetAll()
    {
        var students = new List<Student>
        {
            new Student { Id = 1, Name = "Ram" },
            new Student { Id = 2, Name = "Shyam" }
        };
        return Ok(students);  // Returns JSON
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetById(int id)
    {
        var student = new Student { Id = id, Name = "Ram" };
        return Ok(student);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Create([FromBody] Student student)
    {
        // Save student
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetById), new { id = student.Id }, student);
    }
}
```

***

# PAST QUESTIONS WITH SOLUTIONS

## Q1: "How do you create Controllers, Actions and Action Results? Explain." [10 marks] – 2081

**Answer:**

**Creating Controller:**
A controller is a class that inherits from `Controller` base class and handles HTTP requests.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

public class BookController : Controller
{
    // Actions go here
}
```

**Creating Actions:**
Actions are public methods inside controller that handle specific requests.

```csharp
public class BookController : Controller
{
    // GET: /Book/Index
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var books = GetAllBooks();
        return View(books);
    }

    // GET: /Book/Details/5
    public IActionResult Details(int id)
    {
        var book = GetBookById(id);
        if (book == null)
            return NotFound();
        return View(book);
    }

    // POST: /Book/Create
    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public IActionResult Create(Book book)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            SaveBook(book);
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
        return View(book);
    }
}
```

**Action Result Types:**
- `ViewResult` – renders HTML view
- `JsonResult` – returns JSON data
- `RedirectToActionResult` – redirects to another action
- `ContentResult` – returns plain text
- `FileResult` – returns file download
- `NotFoundResult` – returns 404 status

***

## Q2: "What do you mean by Dependency Injection and IOC Container? Describe methods for creating controller and action with example." [3+7] – 2081-II

**Answer:**

**Dependency Injection (DI):**
DI is a design pattern where an object receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally. It promotes loose coupling and easier testing.

**IOC (Inversion of Control) Container:**
IOC container is a framework that automatically creates and injects dependencies. In ASP.NET Core, the built-in container uses `IServiceCollection` for registration and `IServiceProvider` for resolution.

**Example with Controller and Action:**

```csharp
// 1. Define interface
public interface IBookService
{
    List<Book> GetBooks();
    void AddBook(Book book);
}

// 2. Implement service
public class BookService : IBookService
{
    public List<Book> GetBooks()
    {
        return new List<Book>
        {
            new Book { ISBN = 1, Name = "C# Programming", Author = "John", Price = 500 }
        };
    }

    public void AddBook(Book book)
    {
        // Add to database
    }
}

// 3. Register in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddScoped<IBookService, BookService>();

// 4. Inject in Controller
public class BookController : Controller
{
    private readonly IBookService _bookService;

    public BookController(IBookService bookService)
    {
        _bookService = bookService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var books = _bookService.GetBooks();
        return View(books);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Create(Book book)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            _bookService.AddBook(book);
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
        return View(book);
    }
}
```

## Q3: "Describe the MVC pattern in ASP.NET" [5 marks] – 2081-II

**Answer:**

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an architectural pattern that separates application into three components:

**Model:**
- Represents data and business logic
- Contains entity classes (e.g., Student, Book)
- Handles data validation and database operations

**View:**
- Displays data to user (UI layer)
- Uses Razor syntax (`.cshtml` files)
- Should contain only presentation logic

**Controller:**
- Handles incoming HTTP requests
- Interacts with Model for data operations
- Selects View for response

**Flow:**
```
Request → Controller → Model → Controller → View → Response
```

**Advantages:**
- Separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- Clean HTML output
